Question 1674:
i wonder apart from those very simple hello world apps, what other programs should i try developing for learning. i am entering uni next year and wonder what kind of programs will be developed in that environment. 
this is not really a language specific thing, but if you want to know what i use currently mainly

windows: C#/WPF - i studied java/vb etc in poly but i think C# is the way to go, maybe even F#
web: PHP/MySQL, Zend Framework/Doctrine, + HTML/CSS/JS(jQuery) of course. looking to try google app engine with python too. 

for now, i am thinking of 

todo lists
apps that integrate with api eg. twitter/tumblr which i use
text editor - i am currently trying to develop a text editor that uses markdown and generates html files for viewing (link to blog entry). not very pratical after i started developing it. cos when editing theres no formatting and in HTML format, i cannot edit directly 
blog software (for web)
