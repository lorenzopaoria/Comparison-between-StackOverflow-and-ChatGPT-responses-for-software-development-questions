        "Question": "\"Regular\" golf vs. code golf: Both are competitions.  Both have a well-defined set of rules, which I'll leave out for simplicity.  Both have well-defined goals; in short, \"use fewer hits/characters than your competitors.\" To win matches, athletic golfers rely on  equipment  Some situations call for a sand wedge; others, a 9-iron.   techniques  The drive works better when your feet are about shoulder width apart and your arms are relaxed.   and strategies  Sure, you could take that direct shortcut to the hole... but do you really want to risk the water hazard or sand bunker when those trees are in the way and the wind is so strong?  It might be better to go around the long way.    What do code golfers have that's analagous to athletic golfers' equipment, techniques and strategies? Sample answer to get this started: use the right club!  Choose GolfScript instead of C#. ",
        "Best Answer": "I'd say that thorough knowledge of the syntactical oddities of your language help. Here is one I found in Ruby when doing a bit of code golf: Instead of require \"sequel\" require \"nokogiri\" require \"chronic\"  You can do something like this:  body_of_your_program if %w{sequel nokogiri chronic}.each{|i| require i}  With this kind of thing, you too can write incredibly elaborate Ruby one-liners! In Ruby and Perl, you also get the magic variables like \"$_\" which can be used to do all sorts of magic with strings and regexes. Is your data not strings? Well, you might want to turn it into strings. Obviously, in C, the preprocessor is your friend. "

",
        "Best Answer": "Semicolon insertion in JavaScript. I haven't really been bitten by it often, but it's just such a phenomenally bad idea it makes my head spin.  Here's the rules (from ECMA-262 Section 7.9)  When the program contains a token that is not allowed by the formal grammar, then a semicolon is inserted if (a) there is a line break at that point, or (b) the unexpected token was a closing brace. When the end of a file is reached, if the program cannot be parsed otherwise, then a semicolon is inserted. When a \"restricted production\" is encountered and contains a line terminator in a place where the grammar contains the annotation \"[no LineTerminator here]\", then a semicolon is inserted.

        "Question": "goto is almost universally discouraged. Is using this statement ever worthwhile? ",
        "Best Answer": "This has been discussed several times on Stack Overflow, and Chris Gillum summarized the possible uses of goto:  Cleanly exiting a function Often in a function, you may allocate resources and need to exit in multiple places.  Programmers can simplify their code by putting the resource cleanup code at the end of the function all all \"exit points\" of the function would goto the cleanup label.  This way, you don't have to write cleanup code at every \"exit point\" of the function. Exiting nested loops If you're in a nested loop and need to break out of all loops, a goto can make this much cleaner and simpler than break statements and if-checks. Low-level performance improvements This is only valid in perf-critical code, but goto statements execute very quickly and can give you a boost when moving through a function.  This is a double-edged sword, however, because a compiler typically cannot optimize code that contains gotos.  I'd argue, as many others would argue, that in all of these cases, the usage of goto is used as a means to get out of a corner one coded oneself into, and is generally a symptom of code that could be refactored.

        "Question": "I know that they are implemented extremely unsafely in C/C++. Can't they be implemented in a safer way? Are the disadvantages of macros really bad enough to outweigh the massive power they provide? ",
        "Best Answer": "I think the main reason is that macros are lexical. This has several consequences:  The compiler has no way of checking that a macro is semantically closed, i.e. that it represents a “unit of meaning” like a function does. (Consider #define TWO 1+1 — what does TWO*TWO equal? 3.) Macros are not typed like functions are. The compiler cannot check that the parameters and return type make sense. It can only check the expanded expression that uses the macro. If the code doesn’t compile, the compiler has no way of knowing whether the error is in the macro itself or the place where the macro is used. The compiler will either report the wrong place half of the time, or it has to report both even though one of them is probably fine. (Consider #define min(x,y) (((x)<(y))?(x):(y)): What should the compiler do if the types of x and y don’t match or don’t implement operator<?) Automated tools cannot work with them in semantically useful ways. In particular, you can’t have things like IntelliSense for macros that work like functions but expand to an expression. (Again, the min example.) The side-effects of a macro are not as explicit as they are with functions, causing potential confusion for the programmer. (Consider again the min example: in a function call, you know that the expression for x is evaluated only once, but here you can’t know without looking at the macro.)  Like I said, these are all consequences of the fact that macros are lexical. When you try to turn them into something more proper, you end up with functions and constants. "

        "Question": "Language shortcuts can often be used to make code more concise. For example, ternary and null coalescing operators can reduce the amount of code, but arguably to the detriment of readability: In C#: Person newGuy = new Person(); if (boss == null) {     newGuy.Boss = GetDefaultBoss(); } else {     newGuy.Boss = boss; }  is functionally equivalent to: Person newGuy = new Person(); newGuy.Boss = boss ?? GetDefaultBoss();  but obviously a lot more verbose. Where do you draw the line when it comes to conciseness vs readability? ",
        "Best Answer": "Both. Your first example is certainly more verbose, and arguably more explicit... but it also requires me to scan five lines instead of one. Worse, it deemphasizes its purpose - assigning a value to newGuy.Boss. Your second example may cost me a second if I'm unfamiliar with the null coalescing operator, but there can be no doubt as to its purpose, and if I'm scanning through a larger routine looking for the source of a value, it will be much easier for me to pick this one out. Now, contrast this: if (boss == null) {     newGuy.Boss = GetDefaultBoss();     newGuy.IsTemp = true;     newGuy.AddTask(\"orientation\"); } else {     newGuy.Boss = boss;     newGuy.IsTemp = false; }  ...with: newGuy.Boss = boss ?? GetDefaultBoss(); newGuy.IsTemp = boss == null; if ( boss == null ) newGuy.AddTask(\"orientation\");  The latter example is again much shorter, but now it obscures its purpose by making tasks triggered by the same test appear to be distinct. Here, I feel the verbosity of the former is justified. "

        "Question": "In fact this question is about cautions to be taken to enhance quality user experience and reduce avoidable support calls. ",
        "Best Answer": "A lack of proper input validation is one of those things which tends to lead quite quickly to users doing \"bad\" things with your application, when it should really be handled by the programmer. I've seen legacy apps where users have been trained to:  not enter apostrophes in names not enter any symbol other than a-z0-9, ensure there are no spaces before or after the text they've entered check that a correctly formatted email address is being entered in to the email field, otherwise subsequent mailings to that user will use whatever's in the field and will fail make sure \"http://\" is put before web addresses  etc etc All of the above issues are ones which should be handled by an application developer. When your input validation is essentially \"make sure the user knows what format this field should be in and trust what they've entered is right\", then unexpected things are bound to find their way in to the app. Aside from the obvious security implications, users make mistakes. As programmers we often produce our best products by bending over backwards to make sure that the user can't get it wrong, no matter how hard they try! "

        "Best Answer": "Register Globals in PHP Information : http://php.net/manual/en/security.globals.php This is by far the worst feature to be ever implemented for readability reasons and security reasons.

Also if the feature is misused, it can lead to security hole. Here's a code example from php.net that shows how it can be misused : <?php // define $authorized = true only if user is authenticated if (authenticated_user()) {     $authorized = true; }  // Because we didn't first initialize $authorized as false, this might be // defined through register_globals, like from GET auth.php?authorized=1 // So, anyone can be seen as authenticated! if ($authorized) {     include \"/highly/sensitive/data.php\"; } ?>  "

Being consistent is important, though. So I said let's flip a coin and get on to writing code. I've seen programmers resist change like this before. Get over it! I've switched many times in my career. I even use different styles in my C# than in my PowerShell.  A few years ago I was working on a team (~20 developers) that decided to ask for input, and then make a decision, and then enforce that across all the code base. We'd have 1 week to decide. Lots of groans & eye-rolling. Lots of \"I like my way, because it's better\" but no substance.  As we were studying the finer points of the question, someone asked how to deal with this issue in brace-on-the-same-line style: void MyFunction(     int parameterOne,     int parameterTwo) {     int localOne,     int localTwo }  Note that it's not immediately obvious where the parameter list ends, and the body begins. Compare to: void MyFunction(     int parameterOne,     int parameterTwo)  {     int localOne,     int localTwo }  We did some reading on how folks around the world had dealt with this problem, and found the pattern of adding a blank line after the open brace: void MyFunction(     int parameterOne,     int parameterTwo) {      int localOne,     int localTwo }  If you're going to make a visual break, you may as well do it with a brace. Then your visual breaks become consistent, too. Edit: Two alternatives to the 'extra blank line' solution when using K&R: 1/ Indent the function arguments differently from the function body 2/ Put the first argument on the same line as the function name and align further arguments on new lines to that first argument Examples: 1/ void MyFunction(         int parameterOne,         int parameterTwo) {     int localOne,     int localTwo }  2/ void MyFunction(int parameterOne,                 int parameterTwo) {     int localOne,     int localTwo }  /Edit I still argue that consistency is more important than other considerations, but if we don't have an established precedent, then brace-on-next-line is the way to go.
