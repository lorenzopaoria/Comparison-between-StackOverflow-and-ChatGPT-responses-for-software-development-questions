        "Best answer": "Java is relevant and will continue to be relevant for many years in the Enterprise computing world.   Whether it continues to be relevant in other areas depends a lot on what Oracle does.  If they inject some life (and resources) into ME, desktop applications and other areas, and if they press on with the evolution of the Java language, then Java will do well.   But if Oracle cuts back on R&D and/or tries to stomp other players in the Java space, there's a good chance that someone / some company will develop a better (and more open) Java-like language.  If Oracle win their lawsuit against Google, I predict that the next generation of the Android platform will have a new language, just like happened with C#.  If Google get the openness right ... then, the game is on! ",

        "Question": "For a long time in SO and in other places Java has the reputation of being slow. From jokes to many comments in questions and answers, people still believe Java is slow based solely on experience with it in the 90s. This is my issue: we have disproved (most) of the reasons that people believe Java is slow. Outside of small things, Java is pretty fast. So why is it that people still refuse to believe Java is fast now? Is it part of their mindset that anything thats not C/C++ is slow? Is it because people don't check over time? Is it because people are just biased? ",
