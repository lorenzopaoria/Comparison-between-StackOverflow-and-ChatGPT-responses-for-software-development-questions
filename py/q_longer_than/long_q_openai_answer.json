        "Question": "I have read a few articles on Internet about programming language choice in the enterprise. Recently many dynamic typed languages have been popular, i.e. Ruby, Python, PHP and Erlang. But many enterprises still stay with static typed languages like C, C++, C# and Java. And yes, one of the benefits of static typed languages is that programming errors are caught earlier, at compile time, rather than at run time. But there are also advantages with dynamic typed languages. (more on Wikipedia) The main reason why enterprises don't start to use languages like Erlang, Ruby and Python, seem to be the fact that they are dynamic typed. That also seem to be the main reason why people on StackOverflow decide against Erlang. See Why did you decide \"against\" Erlang. However, there seem to be a strong criticism against dynamic typing in the enterprises, but I don't really get it why it is that strong. Really, why is there so much criticism against dynamic typing in the enterprises? Does it really affect the cost of projects that much, or what? But maybe I'm wrong. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are several reasons why enterprises may be hesitant to adopt dynamic typed languages. One reason is that dynamic typing can make it harder to catch errors early in the development process, as opposed to static typed languages where errors are caught at compile time. This can potentially lead to more bugs and issues in production, which can increase the overall cost of the project.  Additionally, dynamic typing can make it harder to maintain and refactor code, as the lack of type checking can make it more difficult to understand the codebase and make changes without inadvertently introducing bugs. This can result in longer development cycles and increased resources needed to maintain the code over time.  Furthermore, dynamic typing can also lead to performance issues, as the lack of type information can make it harder for the compiler to optimize the code. This can result in slower execution times and higher resource usage, which can be a concern for enterprise applications that require high performance and scalability.  Overall, while dynamic typed languages have their own advantages, such as increased flexibility and productivity, there are valid reasons why enterprises may choose to stick with static typed languages for their projects. It ultimately comes down to the specific requirements and constraints of the project, and what trade-offs are acceptable for the business.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": " The main reason why enterprises don't start to use languages like Erlang, Ruby and Python, seem to be the fact that they are dynamic typed.  I think this is only their primary excuse. The real reason is that businesses don\u2019t really take them all that seriously and feel that they are perhaps a bit too amateur. Java and .NET are \u201cbig business names\u201d, have good commercial marketing, commercial customer support, and are thus widely taken very seriously indeed. It is unfortunate that there is practically no statically-typed language that is anywhere near as popular as the big business names. Why are open-source/free-software programming environments almost always dynamically typed? This might indicate that a statically-typed language is actually not that easy to make, and that dynamic typing is a \u201clazy man\u2019s hack\u201d. If that is the case, the businesses who decide against dynamically-typed languages might actually have a point. ",

        "Question": "During my four years at university we have been using much functional programming in several functional programming languages. But I have also used much object oriented programming to, and in fact I use object oriented languages more when doing my own small project to prepare for my first job. But I often wish that I was coding in a functional programming language when doing these projects. However, when looking for a job, it is very rare to see a job where knowledge of a functional programming language is required. Why isn't functional programming languages used more in the industry? There is quite much news about functional programming languages these days, so I wonder if functional programming is catching on in the industry now? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Functional programming languages have certainly been gaining popularity in recent years, with languages like Clojure, Scala, and Haskell becoming more widely used. However, the dominance of object-oriented programming languages like Java, C++, and Python in the industry can be attributed to a few reasons.  One reason is that object-oriented programming has been around for a longer time and has a larger existing codebase and community. Many companies have legacy codebases written in object-oriented languages, making it easier for them to stick with what they know rather than switch to a functional programming language.  Additionally, object-oriented programming is more intuitive for many developers, as it closely mirrors real-world concepts and allows for easier code organization. Functional programming, on the other hand, can be more challenging for developers to grasp initially, as it involves thinking in a different way about computation.  That being said, the rise of big data and distributed systems has brought functional programming languages into the spotlight, as they are well-suited for handling complex and scalable systems. Companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix have started using functional programming languages in their tech stacks, signaling a shift towards functional programming in the industry.  In conclusion, while functional programming languages may not be as prevalent as object-oriented languages in the industry currently, their usage is growing and they are becoming more important in certain sectors of the industry. As more developers become familiar with functional programming concepts and the benefits they provide, we may see a further increase in their adoption in the future.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I would say that one of the reasons that functional programming is not more prevalent is the lack of knowledge base.  My experience is that corporations are very risk averse in terms of implementing technologies that are not main stream and would rather invest in tried and true frameworks (java, c++, c#).  It's only when there is a business need (like in Ericsson) that new paradigms are considered.  But even in Ericsson's case I heard that management demanded that c++ be used and Joe Armstrong was compelled to code erlang calls in c++!! This should show how reluctant corporations are to implement new technologies! ",
