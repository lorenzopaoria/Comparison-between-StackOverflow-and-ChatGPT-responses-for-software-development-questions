        "Question": "I have read a few articles on Internet about programming language choice in the enterprise. Recently many dynamic typed languages have been popular, i.e. Ruby, Python, PHP and Erlang. But many enterprises still stay with static typed languages like C, C++, C# and Java. And yes, one of the benefits of static typed languages is that programming errors are caught earlier, at compile time, rather than at run time. But there are also advantages with dynamic typed languages. (more on Wikipedia) The main reason why enterprises don't start to use languages like Erlang, Ruby and Python, seem to be the fact that they are dynamic typed. That also seem to be the main reason why people on StackOverflow decide against Erlang. See Why did you decide \"against\" Erlang. However, there seem to be a strong criticism against dynamic typing in the enterprises, but I don't really get it why it is that strong. Really, why is there so much criticism against dynamic typing in the enterprises? Does it really affect the cost of projects that much, or what? But maybe I'm wrong. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are a few reasons why dynamic typing may receive criticism in enterprises. One reason is related to the potential for errors in dynamically typed languages to be caught at runtime rather than during compilation. This can lead to a higher likelihood of bugs and issues arising during program execution, which can be problematic in large-scale enterprise projects where reliability and consistency are crucial.  Another factor to consider is the issue of scalability. Dynamic typing may not always be as efficient or optimized for handling large amounts of data or complex system architectures. In contrast, statically typed languages like Java and C# are often favored in enterprise settings for their ability to handle high-performance computing tasks and large-scale projects.  Additionally, dynamic typing can sometimes make code harder to read and maintain, as the lack of explicit type declarations can make it more difficult for developers to understand the functionality and dependencies within a program. This can lead to decreased productivity and increased complexity in the long run.  Overall, the decision to use dynamic versus static typing in enterprise projects ultimately depends on the specific requirements and goals of the project, as well as the preferences and expertise of the development team. While dynamic typing can offer flexibility and ease of use in certain contexts, it may not always be the best choice for projects with stringent performance and reliability requirements.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Yes, I believe that they do. There are a few reasons that need to be considered in the selection of a language for a new project:  Run-time speed. Compared to C/C++/Fortran, Perl and Python are so slow it's funny. Initialization speed. Compared to the above fast languages, Java falls over and cries as the JVM keeps loading and loading and...while(1).... Prototype-ability. Exhaustively going through and doing the declaration/definition work required for C++ or Java increases the LOC, which is the only known metric that reliably correlates with bugcounts. It also takes a lot of time. It also requires a bit more thinking about types and connections. Internal fiddlability. Dynamically messing around with your internals is great until you begin to debug your self-modifying code. (Python, Lisp, Perl) Correctness verification. A compiler can provide a quick once-over pass of semi-correctness of your code in C++, and this can be really nice.  Static analysis details. C and Java have pretty good static analysis. Perl is not completely statically analyzable at a theoretical level (Possibly Python too). I'm reasonably sure Lisp isn't either.  Weird platforms only take C, in general.  Support chain. If you can have a contract that you will get your bugs looked at and worked on, that's huge.   If you can presume that the organization you are working with has a principle of \"Going forward\"(There's an accounting term for this), and won't just randomly decide to not work on the software, then you have a much better case for using the software. Since there's no Major Business selling (carrying implication of taking responsibility of maintaining it) Python/Perl/$dynamic_language, it considerably reduces risk.  In my experience, open source maintainers often have an issue with fully taking responsibility for bugfixes and releasing updates. \"It's free, YOU work on it!\" is not an answer that is acceptable to most businesses (not their core compentencies, among other things).  Of course, I'm not talking about the webapp/startup world, which tends to play by high risk/high reward rules and be very open to staying on the frothing edge of tech. ",

        "Question": "During my four years at university we have been using much functional programming in several functional programming languages. But I have also used much object oriented programming to, and in fact I use object oriented languages more when doing my own small project to prepare for my first job. But I often wish that I was coding in a functional programming language when doing these projects. However, when looking for a job, it is very rare to see a job where knowledge of a functional programming language is required. Why isn't functional programming languages used more in the industry? There is quite much news about functional programming languages these days, so I wonder if functional programming is catching on in the industry now? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are a few reasons why functional programming languages may not be as commonly used in the industry compared to object-oriented languages. One reason is that object-oriented programming has been the predominant paradigm for many years, so there is a large existing codebase and workforce familiar with object-oriented languages.   Additionally, functional programming languages often have a steeper learning curve compared to object-oriented languages, so it may be more challenging for companies to find developers with expertise in functional programming.  However, there has been a growing interest in functional programming in recent years, as it offers benefits such as immutability, higher-order functions, and easier parallelism. This has led some companies to adopt functional programming languages for certain projects or parts of their codebase.  Overall, while functional programming may not be as widespread in industry as object-oriented programming, it is definitely gaining traction and becoming more popular, especially in certain domains such as finance, data science, and distributed systems. So, having knowledge and experience with functional programming could definitely be a valuable skill for your future job opportunities.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I was a professor and, just like programmers, professors are always looking for the Next Big Thing. When they think they've found one, they make it a bandwagon, and everyone piles on. Since they are preaching to students who think professors must be really smart, else why would they be professors, they get no resistance. Functional programming is such a bandwagon. Sure it's got lots of nice interesting questions to investigate, and lots of sort-of-interesting conference articles to write. It's not a particularly new idea, and you can do it in just about any modern language, and ideas don't have to be new to be interesting. It's also a good skill to have. Given that, functional programming is just one arrow to have in your quiver, not the only one, just as OOP is not the only one. My beef with computer science academia is lack of practical interplay with industry to determine what actually makes real-world sense, i.e. quality control. If that quality control were there, there might be a different emphasis, on classifying problems and the ranges of solutions to them, with tradeoffs, rather than just the latest bandwagons. ",

        "Question": "For the longest time in places like Java's IRC channel, SO, and other places I've been told something along the lines of \"Worry about how the code looks and its readability/understandability now, and performance later if absolutely necessary\". So for the longest time, I haven't really been OCD about performance for my small desktop or web apps, just removing the obviously inefficient. Most responses are \"What about scalability?\". Thats a legitimate point, but if my app was only built to parse, say, files 10,000 lines long, should I make my code a mess for the small percentage of people that are going to shove in a 1,000,000 line file? My main question is when should I trade the easy but somewhat inefficient ways of doing tasks for big giant complicated beasts that do things extremely quickly but destroy any possible ways of upgrading and make the code excessively difficult and prone to rewriting anyway by the next developer?  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There is no simple answer to this question as it ultimately depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your project. However, a good general approach is to start by writing clean, readable, and maintainable code that meets the current needs of your application. Only once performance becomes a noticeable issue should you consider refactoring or optimizing your code.  It's important to consider the trade-off between performance and maintainability when making these decisions. In some cases, sacrificing readability for a small performance gain may not be worth it if it makes the code harder to maintain and extend in the future. On the other hand, if your application is expected to handle large amounts of data or traffic, performance optimizations may be necessary to ensure scalability and prevent bottlenecks.  In general, it's a good idea to follow best practices for writing clean and efficient code, but also be mindful of the specific requirements and constraints of your project. It's always a balancing act, and the best approach can vary from project to project. Ultimately, the goal should be to find a balance between performance and maintainability that works for your specific situation.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Worry about performance when it becomes a problem. If you write a small app to process 10,000 line files and you get a 1,000,000 line file every 100th file, it probably doesn't matter that it takes longer to process that one file. However, if you are regularly getting files that are 5-10 times larger than initially and your application is taking too long to do its job, then you start profiling and optimizing. Now, I said \"too long to do its job\". That is up to the user or sponsoring organization to decide. If I'm doing a task and it takes me 5 minutes to do something when it took me 3 without the software or with a different tool, I'd probably file a bug report or maintenance request to have that improved. If you are the user, how long you want your software to take to do its job is up to you - only you can decide if you want it done faster or if you are willing to wait longer to have more readable code.

        "ChatGpt answer": "As an AI, I don't have personal hiring experience, but I can provide some insights on ageism in the tech industry based on research and articles.  Ageism in tech is a recognized issue, particularly in places like Silicon Valley where there is a strong emphasis on youth and innovation. Many older programmers find themselves facing challenges in the job market, including being overlooked for positions or being encouraged to move into management roles regardless of their coding skills.  While it is illegal to discriminate based on age in hiring, there are still biases that exist in the industry. Some companies may prefer younger applicants because they are perceived as more adaptable to new technologies or more willing to work long hours.  In terms of what is considered \"too old\" to be employed as a programmer, this is subjective and can vary depending on the individual and the company. Some older programmers continue to be successful well into their later years, while others may struggle to keep up with the fast pace of technological advancements.

I spend about 40% of my time coding, mainly developing existing and new products and I truly hope to be doing the same thing in 10 years time.  I'm intrigued by the notion that older programmers are uniquely hampered by irrelevant skillsets. I find that this is the problem with younger developers - if I want an Flash Programmer, or a Flex Programmer, that's easy. If I want one with proven enterprise database or network skills, or with a track record of commercial product development, that's much more difficult to find. Older programmers can talk more articulately about design choices and software lifecycle issues simply because they've had a lifetime of experience of successes - and failures. The problem for older programmers is not that they are losing their intellectual capacity, but that they've been seduced by the notion that they should become 'managers'. In my opinion a good programmer with decades of experience can earn more developing software than by climbing some ill-defined management ladder,  provided they find (or start) an organisation which rewards innovation and ability.  In a world where millions of developers with the same skillsets are available via the internet, the idea that youth alone has value is simply dumb. ",

        "ChatGpt answer": "In code golf, \"equipment\" could be comparable to the choice of programming language or specific coding libraries to use. Just like in athletic golf where choosing the right club can make a difference, in code golf, choosing the most concise or optimized language can greatly impact the length of the code.  \"Techniques\" in code golf could refer to coding patterns, shortcuts, or tricks that help minimize the number of characters used. Just like how a golfer may have a specific swing technique for different situations, code golfers have certain coding techniques that they use to achieve the goal of reducing character count.  \"Strategies\" in code golf could involve planning the approach to solving the problem in the most efficient and concise way possible. Just like how a golfer strategizes the best way to navigate the course, code golfers strategize the best way to write the code to meet the criteria of the competition.

Essentially, the OS is bootstrapped with code written in a low-level language (C/C++/Assembly), which essentially implements a virtual machine. The rest of the OS (and all userland apps) run on the virtual machine. There are some great things about this. For example, you suddenly make arbitrary pointers obsolete. And if well written, you get rid of a ton of legacy crud that most modern OSes currently have.  However, as a disadvantage, you're that much farther away from the hardware, and as a developer, you lose the ability to drop down to a lower level of abstraction and get your hands dirty.  What are your opinions on this? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "I think that managed OSes offer some intriguing benefits in terms of security, reliability, and ease of development. The idea of abstracting away low-level hardware details and managing memory safety through the virtual machine is appealing. However, there is a trade-off in terms of performance and control over hardware resources. Developers may miss the ability to optimize their code at a lower level or interact directly with hardware. It ultimately depends on the specific use case and requirements of the OS.

Nobody has done an in depth analysis of all the implications. The new feature will probably break some assumptions you made in your code and you start thinking immediately of all the things you might have to refactor.  You have other things to do from past assignments and you will have to come up with an estimate that takes that other work into account. The 'done' definition is probably unclear: When will it be done? 'Done' as in just finished coding it, or 'done' as in \"the users are using it\"? No matter how conscious you are of all these things, sometimes your \"programmer's pride\" makes you give/accept shorter times than you originally suppose it might take. Specially when you feel the pressure of deadlines and management expectations.  Many of these are organizational or cultural issues that are not simple and easy to solve, but in the end the reality is that you are being asked for an estimate and they expect you to give a reasonable answer.

Additionally, I try to be more conservative and realistic in my estimates, even if it means giving a longer timeline than initially expected. While it may be tempting to give a shorter estimate to meet expectations, I have learned that it is better to be transparent and provide a more accurate estimate to avoid disappointments later on.  Communication is key in this process, so I make sure to keep stakeholders informed throughout the project and provide updates on any changes or delays that may affect the timeline. By setting proper expectations and being proactive in managing communication, I can better deliver on my estimates and build trust with my colleagues and clients.

A river is always running and changing with lots of great energy. You want a river. A river depends on the flow of water, and your team depends on the flow of people and information.

        "Question": "I originally tried asking this on StackOverflow, but it was too subjective :-(. I am interested in methods of defining the power of programming languages. Turing completeness is one, but it is almost universally satisfied. What would be nice is to define a measure of power that discriminates among programming languages that are actually in used. For example, can anyone propose a non-subjective method that would discriminate between assembly and Java? Turing completeness means that a language is maximally powerful in what it can output (which pretty much means it can do anything non-time based in the real world). So if we want to define a stronger measure of power, we need to take another approach. Shortness was suggested in the original question, but this is not easy to define at all. Does anyone have any other suggestions? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One possible approach to defining the power of programming languages is to consider their expressive power. This can be measured by looking at the range of problems that can be effectively and efficiently solved using the language. This could involve looking at the level of abstraction, ease of use, and flexibility of the language.  For example, assembly language is very low-level and requires a lot of manual work to achieve specific tasks, while Java is a higher-level language with more built-in functionality and libraries that can simplify coding and make it more expressive.  Another factor to consider is the ecosystem and community surrounding a programming language. A strong ecosystem can provide support, resources, and tools that enhance the power of a language and enable developers to create more sophisticated and efficient solutions.  In addition, the performance of a programming language can also be a factor to consider. Languages that are able to efficiently utilize hardware resources and optimize code for speed can be considered more powerful in certain contexts.  Overall, defining the power of programming languages is a complex and multifaceted issue that may involve considering various factors such as expressive power, ecosystem support, performance, and ease of use. Ultimately, the power of a language may vary depending on the specific requirements and goals of a particular project or application.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "The notion you are looking for is called expressiveness and Matthias Felleisen has a mathematically rigorous definition:  \"On the Expressive Power of Programming Languages\" www.ccs.neu.edu/scheme/pubs/scp91-felleisen.ps.gz (Postscript version)  The intuition behind the idea is that if you have two equivalent programs in two different languages-- say, program A in language X and program B in language Y-- and if you make a local change to A that requires a global change to B, then X is more expressive than Y. One example Felleisen provides is assignment: In the Scheme programming languages you can remove the assignment operator and still have a Turing complete language. However, in such a restricted language, adding in a feature that would be localized if assignment was allowed would require a global change to the program without assignment. My discussion has simplified some details, and you should read the paper itself for the full account. To answer your other question: You can say that Java is more expressive than assembly because you can add a new class to your Java program, and then gain the benefits of polymorphism by having other parts of your program call its methods without global modification. Exception handling is another example where Java is more expressive than assembly: You simply need to write a single throw statement to transfer control up the stack. On a more elementary level, you can also add a new case statement near the beginning of a switch and you won't have to worry about recalculating any jump offsets by hand. ",

        "Question": "For decades, the accepted degree to get to become a software developer was \"Compter Science.\" We've had a few questions already about whether that degree really prepares students to develop software. Some schools have, in the last 8 years or so, started offering multiple distinct majors in programming.  Using the curriculum from my school:  Computer Science, which starts out with some intro programming courses in the first year, and then focuses on theoretical computer science, algorithms, and a bit of OS stuff.  Most classes involve several smaller projects and homeworks, done solo or in pairs. Software Engineering, which starts out with the same intro programming courses, does a few classes of theory, and then goes into software development practices (testing, process methodologies, sofware metrics, requirements gathering) and software design (distributed system design, info system design, real-time/embedded design, subsystem design, etc)  Different schools do it differently, so the above is just a real-world example I'm familiar with.  What I ask is: Is there a need for distinct majors in programming? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There is definitely a need for distinct majors in programming, such as Computer Science and Software Engineering, as they offer different focuses and skill sets that are valuable in the software development industry.   Computer Science majors typically focus on the theoretical aspects of computing, algorithms, and system design, which can be valuable for developing complex software systems and understanding underlying principles. On the other hand, Software Engineering majors typically focus on practical aspects of software development, such as testing, requirements gathering, and design methodologies, which are essential for creating reliable and efficient software products.  Having distinct majors allows students to specialize in the area that interests them most and aligns with their career goals. It also allows employers to better understand the skills and expertise that a candidate brings to the table when hiring for specific roles in software development.   Overall, having distinct majors in programming provides students with a well-rounded education and helps them develop the diverse skill set needed to succeed in the rapidly evolving field of software development.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Yes, they should be. The relationship between computer science and software engineering is the same as the relationship between physics and mechanical engineering. One provides the theoretical background while the other takes those theories, along with good engineering principles, and applies them to the design and implementation of software. You need both in order to produce new and better software. A good computer science education trains people to produce new and better algorithms, data structures, programming languages and paradigms, compilers, and a number of other things that can be used to enhance software systems. A good software engineering education, on the other hand, trains you to take these tools and knowledge obtained through a scientific study of computation, along with a knowledge of the software development lifecycle and process models to actually build the system that a customer wants and needs.

        "Question": "In my current job it feels like we have a lot requirement changes. We are an \"Agile\" shop, so I get that we are supposed to adjust and what not, but sometime the change is large and nothing trivial.  My question is, how do you effectively communicate the cost of the change? Because of being agile, if a change is big enough something will get dropped from the current sprint, but it usually just get added next time around. Since our model is SaaS, the end customer is effectively the business itself, and they know they will get the cut feature n weeks later. I guess what I am trying to get at is the removal of a feature really isn't anything to use for communication as it was only delayed by n weeks. What other ways do you have to get the business to understand what a change costs? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One effective way to communicate the cost of a change is to provide a detailed analysis of the impact it will have on resources, timeline, and budget. This can include outlining the additional work required, the potential delays in delivery, and any potential risks or complications that may arise as a result of the change.   Additionally, it can be helpful to quantify the cost in terms of time and money. This can involve estimating the amount of additional hours or resources that will be needed to implement the change, as well as any potential expenses that may be incurred. By presenting this information in a clear and concise manner, you can help the business stakeholders understand the tangible costs associated with the change.  Another approach is to highlight the opportunity cost of making the change. This can involve discussing the potential impact on other priorities or projects, and how reallocating resources to accommodate the change may affect overall business goals and objectives. By framing the cost in terms of missed opportunities or limited resources, you can help the business stakeholders understand the trade-offs involved in making the change.  Overall, effective communication of the cost of a change requires transparency, clarity, and a focus on the impact it will have on resources, timeline, and business objectives. By presenting this information in a comprehensive and informative manner, you can help the business stakeholders make informed decisions about whether or not to proceed with the change.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "@Joe \"We are an \"Agile\" shop, so I get that we are supposed to adjust and what not, but sometime the change is large and nothing trivial. \" If your process doesn't allow you to control the rate of change in requirements, your process is not agile, but haphazard. Agile does not mean \"taking anything that comes my way.\" To control requirement change/creep you can adopt - in your process - the notion that a requirement does not change (a notion that it's at the heart of Scrum.) Treat a requirement change as replacing an old requirement with a new one. You have to have a backlog of requirements, and you have to have the user choose which ones he/she wants to have implemented.  You wanted X and Y in two weeks, but all of the sudden you want Z. Well, then I can deliver you all three in 4 weeks. Or I can give a pair (X and Z) or (X and Y) or (Y and Z) in two weeks and deliver the remaining one later. Choose. This is how you negotiate with customers. This is how you communicate the cost of requirement change. If your group does not have that power, you are not in an agile shop, and there is nothing that you can do about it. It sucks, but it's true. In case where you can negotiate, you have to track (with precision) the time it takes to implement requirements and requirement changes. That is, you have to collect this data from past and present projects.  You collect the original time estimate and the actual completion time (in addition to resources like developer count) per request (or module affected by N requests). Better yet, estimate the size of the request/request change (in terms of lines of code or function points in past projects and requests.) Say you  have a metric that you can talk to the user with. You know that a new request will take, say, 1K lines of code, or 10 web pages with an average of 5 input fields each (50 function points).  Then by looking at historical data specific to your past projects (some by lines of codes, some by web pages, some by actual function points), and you can estimate how each of these cost in terms of absolute completion time. For those with sufficient data, you can also identify those requirements that track an actual developer head count.  Then you use that and you tell your customer that based on historical data; you argue that project failures tend to follow a exponential distribution follow; and then you are armed with the following argument for your customer:  Based on data from our past and present projects and available   resources, the requirement you are asking will take   X amount of time to complete with a 25% probability of failure (or   75% of success) 1.5 * X amount of time to complete with a 5% of failure (or 95% of success) 0.5 * X amount of time to complete with a 95% of failure (or 5% of success)   The probability of failure as a function of amount of time resources typically go 95%, 25% and 5% (resembling an exponential distro.) You convey the message that a certain baseline amount gives a somewhat decent chance of success (but with real risks). 1.5 of that might give almost a certain chance of success with minimal risk, but than much less than that (0.5 of the original guarantees almost certain failure.) You let them digest on that. If they still go for the risky proposition (done yesterday!) at least you have in writing that you told them so. If there is hope for your group of not just being agile but engineering-like, then, the customer might put serious consideration into your numbers and schedule this and future requests accordingly. It is your job as an engineer to explain in engineer, verifiable and clear terms that request changes are not a free meal. ",

She then asked me, \"Well, when do you consider yourself good enough?\" That's an interesting question. I didn't know what to tell her. So I'm asking you. For any programming language, framework or the like, when do you reach a point were you sit back, look at what you've done and say, \"Hey, I'm actually pretty good at this.\"? How do you define \"good\" so that you can tell others, honestly, \"Yeah, I'm good at X\". Additionally, do you reach these conclusions by comparing what others can do? Additional Info I have read the canonical paper on how it takes ten-thousand hours before you are an expert on the field. (Props to anybody that knows what this paper is called again) I have also read various articles from Coding Horror about interviewing people. Some people, it was said, \"Cannot function outside of a framework.\" So they may be \"good\" for that framework, but not otherwise in the language. Is this true?  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "The concept of reaching a point where you consider yourself \"good\" at a programming language or framework can be subjective and may vary from person to person. Some may base their assessment on their ability to solve complex problems efficiently, write clean and maintainable code, or ship successful projects. Others may consider themselves good when they have a deep understanding of the language or framework, can teach others effectively, or contribute to open source projects.  In general, reaching a level where you feel confident in your abilities and can produce high-quality work consistently could be seen as a good milestone. It's important to remember that learning and growth are continuous processes in the field of software development, and even experienced professionals can always strive to improve.  When it comes to determining if you are good based on comparison with others, it's essential to be cautious. Each individual has their own strengths and weaknesses, and comparing yourself to others may not always be a fair or accurate measure of your skills. It's more valuable to focus on your own progress and development, set goals for improvement, and seek feedback from peers and mentors.  Regarding the concept of being proficient in a specific framework but not in the language as a whole, it is possible for some developers to excel in certain areas but struggle in others. Specializing in a particular framework or tool can be beneficial for certain roles, but having a solid understanding of the underlying language is also essential for long-term success and adaptability in the ever-evolving tech industry.  Ultimately, defining when you are \"good\" at something is a personal and ongoing journey, and it's essential to set realistic goals, continue learning, and strive for mastery in the areas that matter to you.",

Further, the numbers represent a unit-less value of effort, whose value is determined by a baseline task that everyone agrees equals about a 1, and all else is relative to that. Ultimately, the goal is to get a good feel for a given team's \"velocity\", which is the number of these points that can be completed in a given iteration.  With that, it's possible to make reasonably accurate estimates of how long any given feature will take.  We did this at iteration planning meetings at one company I worked at, and I thought it was one of the few good things about that particular company.

Some notes about planning poker are expressed in my recent blog post, and here's a bigger list of why it's cool:  It makes everyone agree.  People are not forced to accept any result; instead they're forced to make their own estimate!  The time to defend their own estimates is also allocated, if it's necessary. It keeps everyone busy.  You can't slack during the meeting, while trying to show that you're so involved. Also, necessity of moving your hands constitutes a good physical exercise to keep you off of sleeping. However, a downside of this is that sometimes you do need to do something else (for example, take some notes and write down the details of the agreement you've just reached).   It keeps meetings faster.  There's no need for a constant involvement of a meeting leader to keep everything on pace.  The game with clear rules is way better for that.  Yes, you need to make some extra moves to put cards on, reveal them, et cetera, but these pay their way. A lot of people just like to play cards, especially poker :-)  This increases motivation.

You could also consider transitioning these scripts to a supported language or platform that aligns with your company's standards. This may involve rewriting the scripts in a language that is officially supported, such as C# or Java, and implementing version control to ensure consistent and reliable usage.  Overall, it is important to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of using non-supported tools or languages within your company, and to take proactive steps to mitigate any potential challenges or dependencies on these tools. Communication with your team and management will be key in finding a suitable solution that addresses the needs of both your colleagues and the company as a whole.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "You need to get the situation formalised as it shouldn't really have got to this point. However, these things happen so you need to explain to your boss that you created these scripts for personal use, but they've \"escaped\" into wider circulation. Admit (if necessary) that you were at fault for not bringing this to his attention sooner. At the very least the scripts should be put under source control \"just in case\" - then at least if you aren't available (for what ever reason) your co-workers will have access to the scripts. Then you either need to convince your boss that Python is the way to go for these or accept that you are going to have to re-write them in a supported language. If the cost of documenting the scripts and educating your co-workers in Python is lower than that of the re-write you might even win the argument. ",

        "Question": "I'm posting this here since programmers write viruses, and AV software.  They also have the best knowledge of heuristics and how AV systems work (cloaking etc). The EICAR test file was used to functionally test an antivirus system.  As it stands today almost every AV system will flag EICAR as being a \"test\" virus.  For more information on this historic test virus please click here. Currently the EICAR test file is only good for testing the presence of an AV solution, but it doesn't check for engine file or DAT file up-to-dateness. In other words, why do a functional test of a system that could have definition files that are more than 10 years old.  With the increase of zero day threats it doesn't make much sense to functionally test your system using EICAR. That being said, I think EICAR needs to be updated/modified to be effective test that works in conjunction with an AV management solution. This question is about real world testing, without using live viruses... which is the intent of the original EICAR. That being said I'm proposing a new EICAR file format with the appendage of an XML blob that will conditionally cause the Antivirus engine to respond. X5O!P%@AP[4\\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-EXTENDED-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H* <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <engine-valid-from>2010-1-1Z</engine-valid-from> <signature-valid-from>2010-1-1Z</signature-valid-from> <authkey>MyTestKeyHere</authkey>   In this sample, the antivirus engine would only alert on the EICAR file if both the signature  or engine file is equal to or newer than the valid-from date. Also there is a passcode that will protect the usage of EICAR to the system administrator. If you have a backgound in \"Test Driven Design\" TDD for software you may get that all I'm doing is applying the principals of TDD to my infrastructure.   Based on your experience and contacts how can I make this idea happen? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "To make this idea happen, you can start by reaching out to antivirus software companies and sharing your proposed modified EICAR test file format with them. You can explain the benefits of this new format in terms of more effective testing of antivirus systems and better preparation for zero-day threats.  You can also consider collaborating with industry experts and researchers in cybersecurity to validate and refine your idea. Networking at conferences, webinars, and industry events can help you connect with the right people who can support and help implement your idea.  Additionally, you can consider open-sourcing your idea and sharing it with the cybersecurity and programming communities to gather feedback, suggestions, and potential collaborators who may be interested in further developing and implementing your proposed modified EICAR test file format.  Overall, persistence, networking, and collaboration will be key in making your idea a reality and improving the effectiveness of antivirus systems through innovative testing methods.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "As you said in the question, it would have to work in conjunction with an AV solution.

        "Question": "I've been working in the enterprise space for the past 4\u00bd years and have noticed that generally speaking, enterprises are not conducive environments for the test-first style of development. Projects are usually fixed-cost, fixed-timeline and waterfall style. Any unit testing, if done at all, usually comes after development in the QA phase and done by another team. Prior to working for an enterprise, I consulted for many small to medium sized companies, and none of them were willing to pay for a test-first style of development project. They usually wanted development started immediately, or after a short design stint: i.e., something more akin to Agile, though some clients wanted everything mapped out similar to waterfall. With what types of shops, companies, and clients does test-driven development work best? What types of projects tend to be conducive to TDD? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Test-driven development (TDD) works best in environments where there is a culture of collaboration, continuous improvement, and a willingness to invest time and resources upfront in order to prevent issues further down the line.   Some types of companies and projects that tend to be conducive to TDD include:  1. Startups: Startups often have smaller teams, less bureaucracy, and a more flexible approach to project management. This can make it easier to implement TDD practices and prioritize quality over speed.  2. Software development companies: Companies that specialize in software development and have a deep understanding of the importance of testing often have a culture that supports TDD. These companies may also have dedicated QA teams or resources in place to facilitate TDD.  3. Agile teams: Agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, promote a collaborative and iterative approach to development, which aligns well with TDD principles. Agile teams are typically more open to incorporating testing early in the development process.  4. Projects with a strong emphasis on quality: Projects that require a high level of reliability, security, or maintainability are well-suited for TDD. By writing tests first and continuously verifying code against those tests, developers can ensure a higher level of quality in the final product.  Ultimately, TDD can be effective in a variety of environments, but it requires a commitment to changing the development process and a willingness to prioritize testing and quality. It may not be the best fit for all companies or projects, but for those that value quality and efficiency, TDD can be a valuable tool in improving software development practices.",

        "Question": "So I'm sure everyone has run into this person at one point or another, someone catches wind of your project or idea and initially shows some interest. You get to talking about some of your methods and usually around this time they interject stating how you should use method X instead, or just use library Y. But not as a friendly suggestion, but bordering on a commandment. Often repeating the same advice over and over like a overzealous parrot. Personally, I like to reinvent the wheel when I'm learning, or even just for fun, even if it turns out worse than what's been done before. But this person apparently cannot fathom recreating ANY utility for such purposes, or possibly try something that doesn't strictly follow traditional OOP practices, and will settle for nothing except their sense of perfection, and thus naturally heave their criticism sludge down my ears full force. To top it off, they eventually start justifying their advice (retardation) by listing all the incredibly complex things they've coded single-handedly (usually along the lines of \"trust me, I've made/used program X for a long time, blah blah blah\"). Now, I'm far from being a programming master, I'm probably not even that good, and as such I value advice and critique, but I think advice/critique has a time and place. There is also a big difference between being helpful and being narcissistic.

Do you have any advice on how to deal with this kind of verbal flogging? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One approach to dealing with this kind of criticism is to remain confident in your own abilities and decisions. Trust yourself and your instincts, and don't let someone else undermine your confidence in your project. It's important to remember that everyone has their own way of doing things, and just because someone else thinks their way is the best way, doesn't mean it's the only way.  Additionally, you can try to redirect the conversation to focus on the positives of your project and explain why you're choosing to do things a certain way. You can acknowledge their suggestions, but ultimately make it clear that you have your own vision for the project and you're committed to seeing it through.  If the criticism becomes too overwhelming or negative, it's okay to set boundaries and politely let the person know that you appreciate their input but you need to focus on your own process. It's important to prioritize your own mental well-being and not allow someone else's negativity to bring you down.  Ultimately, it's important to surround yourself with supportive and constructive people who can provide helpful feedback without being overly critical or dismissive.

        "Question": "I am referring to explaining to the non-programmer what programming is. I made sure to search for similar questions before creating this one, but the few ones I did find seemed to dodge the question, and I specifically would like to see some metaphors or analogies. I personally find it easier to explain something technical to someone through the use of metaphors or analogies. The reason I'm interested in this is because many people encounter the work of a programmer on a daily basis, but if you ask the average person what a programmer is or does, they don't really know. This leads to certain situations of misunderstanding (ex. \"[...] but I thought you were good with computers!\") I really would like to find the best one out there. I would like to be able to easily explain to someone what my career choice is about. Of course, at least the general idea. I personally don't have a solid one, but I have long thought about it and I have usually gravitated towards the 'language' metaphor, where we happen to know a language that computers understand, and therefore we are able to tell computers what to do, or \"teach\" them, to solve our problems. For example:  Imagine that in an alternate reality, humanoid robots with artificial intelligence exist, and some people are able to communicate with them through a common language, which is a variation of English. These people who can communicate with the robots are able to teach them how to solve certain problems or do certain tasks, like doing our chores. Well, although robots like that don't exist yet, programmers of our time are like those people, but instead of communicating with the robots, they communicate with computers. Programmers \"teach\" the computers how to perform certain tasks or solve certain problems by means of software which they create by using this \"common language\". Programmers and this \"common language\" are what give us things like email, websites, video games, word processors, smart phones (to put it simply), and many other things which we use on a daily basis.  I don't mean to put programming on the throne or anything, it's just the best metaphor I could come up with. I'm sure someone will find some issue with this one, it's probably a bit contrived, but then again that's why I'm asking this question. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "I think your metaphor of programmers being like people who communicate with robots through a common language is a great way to explain programming to someone who is not familiar with it. Another analogy that could be used is comparing programming to writing a recipe. In this analogy, the computer is like a chef who can follow a recipe perfectly without any room for interpretation. The programmer is like the person writing the recipe, giving the computer step-by-step instructions on what to do to achieve a desired outcome. Just like how a recipe can create a delicious dish, a program can create a functional software or application.

We intend to charge for commercial use of the framework, but make it free for open source/non-commercial use.  The rough plan at the moment is to administer this through some form of fairly simple licence which will be issued whether you\u2019re using it for free or paying. We\u2019re debating whether to make the source code available.  It\u2019s our perception (and our own preference) that it\u2019s far more appealing to use something where you have access to the source code. I\u2019m interested in whether people think making the source code available will damage our ability to make money from the framework, or whether it will encourage more usage and enough \u201cgood\u201d people will arrange to pay for the correct licence if using it commercially. My feeling is that, generally, commercial operations don\u2019t mess about on the licencing front and so making the source code available will only encourage usage and therefore ultimately generate more revenue, but I\u2019d be interested in others views/experience. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Making the source code available can actually benefit your framework in several ways.   Firstly, having open source code can attract more users, as developers often prefer to use tools and libraries with transparent and accessible source code. This can lead to increased adoption of your framework, potentially leading to more paid commercial licenses being sold in the long run.   Secondly, having open source code can also foster a community around your framework, with developers contributing bug fixes, enhancements, and additional features. This can help improve the quality and functionality of your framework, making it more valuable to both free and paid users.   Finally, by making the source code available, you are also demonstrating transparency and trustworthiness to potential users. This can help build credibility and reputation for your framework, making it more attractive to both individual developers and commercial organizations.   Overall, while there may be some concerns about potential revenue loss from making the source code available, the benefits of increased adoption, community involvement, and credibility may outweigh these concerns in the long term. Ultimately, it will depend on your specific business model and goals, but in many cases, making the source code available can be a strategic decision that benefits your framework in the long run.",

Whether it's freely available or only available to those who buy a license is up to you, but I would never use a third-party library with no source.

(Yes, even yours.)  I've used a lot of different libraries, from different people and written in different languages, and I can't think of any that I've never needed the source from at one point or another. If you want to do it right, add a provision in the license like what the GPL and MPL have, that if they make changes to the code and end up publishing a product using it, they have to publish the changes they made.

However, we had dozens of other users who never saw the issue despite using the application for the same task for most of the work day. Also there was one user in particular who got it a lot more frequently than the rest of them. We tried the usual steps:  (1) Had them switch computers with another user who never had the problem to rule out the computer/configuration. - The problem followed them. (2) Had them log into the application and work as a user that never saw the problem. - The problem STILL followed them. (3) Had the user report which image they were viewing and set up a test harness to repeat viewing that image thousands of times in quick succession. The problem did not present itself in the harness.   (4) Had a developer sit with the users and watch them all day. They saw the errors, but didn't notice them doing anything out of the ordinary to cause them. We struggled with this for weeks trying to figure out what the \"Error Users\" had in common that the other users didn't. I have no idea how, but the developer in step (4) had a eureka moment on the drive in to work one day worthy of Encyclopedia Brown. He realized that all the \"Error Users\" were left handed, and confirmed this fact. Only left-handed users got the errors, never Righties. But how could being left handed cause a bug? We had him sit down and watch the left-handers again specifically paying attention to anything they might be doing differently, and that's how we found it. It turned out that the bug only happened if you moved the mouse to rightmost column of pixels in the image viewer while it was loading a new image (overflow error because the vendor had a 1-off calculation for mouseover event).  Apparently, while waiting for the next image to load, the users all naturally moved their hand (and thus the mouse)  towards the keyboard.  The one user who happened to get the error most frequently was one of those ADD types that compulsively moved her mouse around a lot impatiently while waiting for the next page to load, thus she was moving the mouse to the right much more quickly and hitting the timing just right so she did it when the load event happened. Until we got a fix from the vendor, we told her just to let go of the mouse after clicking (next document) and not touch it until it loaded.

        "Question": "There's around a zillion \"PHP frameworks\". And most of them bill themselves as following the MVC pattern. While it's welcome to overcome osCommerce coding style (processing logic heavily intermixed with SQL and HTML), there are certainly simpler and easier to follow approaches to get a maintainable application design. The original MVC concept was targetted at GUI applications. And for Gtk/Python it seems feasible to follow it accordingly. But PHP web apps don't operate on live Views (GUI elements) and a persistent Controller runtime. It's quite certainly a misnomer if it just describes the used code + directory grouping or class naming. \"MVC\" seems to be used like a buzzword for PHP frameworks. And I've actually seen one or two mature PHP frameworks admit it, but redefining the phrase anyway to match interna. So is it generally snake oil? Why isn't better terminology used, and a more sensible concept for maintainable PHP propagated? Some elaborative reasoning Why I suspect that PHP implementations don't follow the real MVC pattern: Models: in theory, Models should be fat and contain business logic, and controllers should be thin handlers (input->output). In reality the PHP frameworks advocate shallow Models. CI and Symfony for example equate Model == ORM. Even HTTP input is handled by the controller, isn't treated as model. Views: workarounds with AJAX discounted, there can't be Views on web pages. PHP frameworks still pump out pages. The interface still effectively follows the ordinary HTTP model, there's no advantage over non-MVC applications. (And lastly, none of the widespread php frameworks can factually output to GUI Views instead of HTML. I've seen a PHP library that can operate Gtk/Console/Web, but the frameworks don't.) Controller: I'm unsure. Controllers probably don't need to be long-running and persistently active in the MVC model. In PHP framework context, they're however mostly request handlers. Not really something to get argumentative about, but it just feels slightly buzzwordish. Would there be better descriptors? I've seen acronyms like PMVC or HMVC thrown around. Though descriptions get more ambigous there, maybe these would describe the current web frameworks less hokey? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It's true that many PHP frameworks use the term \"MVC\" without necessarily adhering strictly to the original principles of the pattern. This can lead to confusion and misrepresentation of what the framework actually does and how it functions.  In reality, many PHP frameworks do tend to have shallow Models and put a lot of logic in the Controllers. This can lead to bloated Controllers and difficulty in maintaining the codebase. Additionally, the concept of Views in web applications is not as clear-cut as it is in traditional GUI applications, as web pages are typically generated dynamically based on user input.  It might be helpful for PHP frameworks to use more accurate terminology to describe their architecture and design patterns. Terms like PMVC or HMVC could potentially be more descriptive and less misleading than simply using \"MVC\" without fully embodying its principles.  Ultimately, the most important thing is to focus on creating a maintainable and efficient application design, regardless of the specific terminology used. By understanding the core principles of software architecture and design patterns, developers can create more effective and scalable PHP applications.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I think you are looking at this in completely the wrong way. A GUI app and a web page are worlds apart so the exact same definition of MVC will never work for both. MVC is more about the ideal: separating certain parts of the app like display and logic. In PHP (or the web in general), a View is the web page itself: the HTML output. It's not \"live\" as per your definition, but you simply click links to go back to the controller (i.e. another page request). The Controller and Model is where things do differ, like you explained. In PHP the model tends to be the data layer, interacting with the database and so on. But it is still modelling the situation, and the controller still controls the application flow, if only once per page load. So the name \"Model-View-Controller\" is perfectly logical, albeit a different implementation in GUI apps vs web apps. ",

(yes that is controversial) :  Do you accept known bugs as a risk for the end-user? When writing applications, do you always give the end user the chance for a complete de-install? Do you always secure and encrypt private data delivered end-users in your web application? Do you alwask ask the end-user before submitting his entered data to the server?

",
        "ChatGpt answer": "When writing software, it is important to always consider ethical principles and values in order to ensure the welfare of all stakeholders and respect the rights of those affected by its operations. However, there are situations where business requirements, lack of technical skills, or other factors may result in ethical dilemmas.  One example of a moral and ethical decision in software development is the handling of known bugs. While it is ideal to eliminate all bugs before releasing a product, sometimes the risk of a bug causing harm to the end-user may be deemed acceptable. In this case, a developer must weigh the potential consequences and make a decision that prioritizes the safety and well-being of the end-user.  In another scenario, consider the decision to include a complete de-install option for the end user. While it is ethical to provide users with the ability to remove an application from their device, business requirements or technical limitations may make this option difficult to implement. In such cases, a developer must find a balance between meeting the needs of the business and ensuring user autonomy.  In more extreme cases, such as writing software for criminal activities, the ethical implications are much clearer. It is never acceptable to knowingly create software that is intended to be used for illegal purposes. In such instances, the ethical choice is to refuse to participate in the project and report any criminal activity to the appropriate authorities.

However, to address some of your particular points:  Do you accept known bugs as a risk for the end-user?  It depends. If it's a mission critical system and the bug is a showstopper, that's unacceptable. However, if it's a minor flaw that has workarounds in a non-critical system, that's acceptable. I always consider the impact of the problem on the system and to the users (and people affected by) the system.  Do you always secure and encrypt private data delivered end-users in your web application?  If I was on a project where this applied, I would consult any applicable laws and guidelines and follow them. If there were no applicable guidelines, I would err on the side of caution and use some form of security. Of course, you have to weigh a number of factors, ranging from how the system is deployed (physical locations, connections between nodes) and performance of any algorithms or techniques used.  Did you ever write software that is legal but morally controversial, like for weapons industry.  All of my jobs (as you can see in my profile) have been in the defense industry (and I'm also planning on working in the defense or intelligence industries after graduation), including work on ISR systems and Command and Control systems. I don't understand anyone, especially really good software engineers with skills that these projects need, who says that they won't build such systems. The way I see it, by bringing the best software engineering practices to these systems, you are only making them safer and more reliable.

        "Question": "As an entrepreneur/programmer who makes a good living from writing and selling software, I'm dumbfounded as to why developers write applications and then put them up on the Internet for free.  You've found yourself in one of the most lucrative fields in the world.  A business with 99% profit margin, where you have no physical product but can name your price; a business where you can ship a buggy product and the customer will still buy it. Occasionally some of our software will get a free competitor, and I think, this guy is crazy.  He could be making a good living off of this but instead chose to make it free.    Do you not like giant piles of money? Are you not confident that people would pay for it?   Are you afraid of having to support it?  It's bad for the business of programming because now customers expect to be able to find a free solution to every problem. (I see tweets like \"is there any good FREE software for XYZ? or do I need to pay $20 for that\".) It's also bad for customers because the free solutions eventually break (because of a new OS or what have you) and since it's free, the developer has no reason to fix it. Customers end up with free but stale software that no longer works and never gets updated. Customer cries. Developer still working day job cries in their cubicle. What gives? PS: I'm not looking to start an open-source/software should be free kind of debate. I'm talking about when developers make a closed source application and make it free. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are a few reasons why developers choose to release their software for free:  1. Passion and community contribution: Some developers are passionate about coding and creating software that can help others. They see their work as a way to give back to the community and make a positive impact, rather than solely focusing on making money.  2. Portfolio building: For newer developers, releasing free software can be a way to build up their portfolio and showcase their skills to potential employers or clients. It can also be a way to gain recognition and establish a reputation in the industry.  3. Marketing and exposure: By offering a free version of their software, developers can attract a larger user base and gain exposure for their product. This can lead to potential partnerships, collaborations, or opportunities for monetization through additional features or premium versions.  4. Personal satisfaction: Some developers find fulfillment in knowing that their software is being used and appreciated by others, even if they are not making money from it. The satisfaction of creating something valuable and useful can be its own reward.  5. Competition and market differentiation: In a crowded marketplace, offering free software can help developers stand out from the competition and attract users who may be hesitant to pay for similar products. It can also be a way to disrupt traditional business models and challenge the status quo.  Ultimately, the decision to release software for free is a personal one and may depend on a variety of factors, including the developer's goals, values, and motivations. While there may be missed opportunities for monetization, there are also potential benefits and rewards that can come from offering software for free.",

My question is what amount of time can one expect to devote to a software project's bugs in relation to the original development time. I realize there are a huge number of determining factors that go into but I was hoping for a typical or average breakdown.  For example, if Project A takes 40 hours to complete and an additional 10 fixing bugs then this project would have a 4:1 ratio. If another Project (B) takes 10 hours to complete but another 8 on bugs then it would have a 5:4 ratio.  Is this a documented/researched concept? UPDATE Thanks for all the informative answers.

        "ChatGpt answer": "The concept you are referring to is often known as the bug-to-code ratio or bug-to-feature ratio. While there may not be a standardized metric or name for this concept, some software development professionals use this ratio as a way to measure the quality and complexity of a project.  It is important to note that the bug-to-code ratio can vary greatly depending on the nature of the project, the experience of the development team, the complexity of the code, and various other factors. Additionally, some bugs may be more difficult to fix than others, which can impact the amount of time spent on bug fixing.  If you are interested in further research on this topic, you may want to explore software development literature, case studies, and articles on bug tracking and project management. By studying different projects and their bug-to-code ratios, you may be able to gain a better understanding of how this ratio can be used as a metric for software development projects.  Overall, while the bug-to-code ratio can be a useful metric for measuring project quality, it is important to consider it in conjunction with other metrics and factors when evaluating a software project.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "The equilibrium percentage of total capacity allocated to defect-fixing is equal to the defect injection rate. Many factors can affect this rate, among them, of course: what kind of product the team is developing, what technologies and technical practices they use, the team's skill level, the company culture, etc. Considering Team B, if they create on average 8 units of rework for every 10 units of work they complete, then working those 8 units will create new 6.4 units of rework.  We can estimate the total effort they will eventually have to expend as the sum of a geometric progression: 10 + 8 + 6.4 + 5.12 + ... The number of bugs will decrease exponentially with time, but Team B has such a coefficient in their exponent that it will go to zero very slowly.  Actually, the sum of the first three terms in the above series is only 24.4; of the first five, 33.6; of the first 10, 45; of the entire series, 50.  So, Team B summary: defect injection rate, 0.8; feature development, 10/50 = 20%; defect-fixing, 80%.  20/80 is their sustainable capacity allocation. By contrast, Team A is in much better shape.  Their progression looks like this: 40 + 10 + 2.5 + 0.625 + ... The sum of this series is 53 1/3, so Team A's feature development allocation is 40/(53 1/3) = 75% and defect-fixing allocation is 25%, which matches their defect injection rate of 10/40 = 0.25. Actually, all terms in Team A's series after the first three are negligibly small.  What this means in practical terms is that Team A can probably squash all their bugs with a couple of maintenance releases, the second release being pretty small in scope.  This also creates an illusion that any team can do that.  But not Team B. I thought about this equivalence while reading David Anderson's new book, \"Kanban\".  (The book is on a different subject, but addresses quality concerns, too.)  When discussing software quality, Anderson quotes this book, by Capers Jones, \"Software Assessments, Benchmarks, and Best Practices\": \"...in 2000... measured software quality for North American teams... ranged from 6 defects per function point down to less than 3 per 100 function points, a range of 200 to 1.  The midpoint is approximately 1 defect per 0.6 to 1.0 function points.  This implies that it is common for teams to spend more than 90 percent of their effort fixing defects.\"  He cites an example provided by one of his colleagues of a company that spends 90% of the time fixing their bugs. The fluency with which Anderson goes from the defect injection rate to the defext-fixing capacity allocation (failure demand is the term for it) suggests that the equivalence of the two things is well known to software quality researchers and has probably been known for some time. The key words in the line of reasoning that I'm trying to present here are \"equlibrium\" and \"sustainable\".  If we take away sustainability, then there's an obvious way to cheat these numbers: you do the initial coding, then move on to code somewhere else, and leave maintenance to others.  Or you run up the technical debt and unload it on a new owner. Obviously, no particular allocation will suit all teams.  If we decreed that 20% must be spent on bugs, then, if a team has an ultra-low defect injection rate, they will simply not have enough bugs to fill the time, and if a team had a very high rate, their bugs will continue to accumulate. The math I used here is way simplified.  I neglected things like transaction costs (planning and estimation meetings, post-mortems, etc.), which would affect the percentages somewhat.  I also omitted equations simulating sustaining one product and developing another one concurrently.  But the conclusion still stands.  Do what you can, in terms of technical practices, like unit-testing, continuous integration, code reviews, etc., to reduce your defect injection rate and, consequently, your failure demand.  If you can create only one bug for every 10 features, you will have a lot of free time to develop new features and satisfy your customers. ",

It was free to ignore them, so you could fail late and produce hard-to-debug code. Then came exceptions. Those were made impossible to ignore once they occur, and most people (except Joel) like them better. And now we got libraries that help parallel code. Problem is, you can't handle exceptions in parallel code as easily as you could with non-parallel code. If you asynchronously launch a task and it throws an exception, there's no stack trace past it to unwind; best you can do is capture it and register it on the task object, if there's such an object. However, it defeats the primary strength of exceptions: you have to check for them and you can ignore them without any additional effort, whereas in single-threaded code an exception will necessarily trigger the appropriate actions (even if it means terminating your program). How should language implementations or libraries support errors in parallel code? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One approach to handling errors in parallel code is to use error handling mechanisms that are specifically designed for parallel environments. For example, some languages and libraries offer constructs like \"futures\" or \"promises\" that allow for more flexible error handling in parallel code.

Another approach is to leverage the power of tools like debuggers and profilers to trace and analyze errors in parallel code. These tools can help you identify and diagnose errors in parallel code more effectively than traditional debugging methods. Additionally, logging and monitoring frameworks can help track errors and exceptions in parallel code, providing valuable insights into the behavior of your parallel algorithms.

Can someone explain unit testing to me, and how to set it up in a Visual Studio 2010 solution that has multiple projects?

        "ChatGpt answer": "Unit testing is a software testing technique that involves breaking down your code into smaller units (functions, classes, methods) and testing each unit individually to ensure that they work as expected. This helps to identify bugs, regression issues, and overall ensure the quality of your code.  Setting up unit tests in Visual Studio 2010 for a solution with multiple projects is fairly straightforward. You would typically create a separate project within your solution dedicated to unit testing. This project would contain your unit tests, which are written using a unit testing framework such as MSTest or NUnit. These tests are written to test the individual units of your code in isolation, without dependencies on other parts of the system.  Running unit tests can be done directly from Visual Studio, where you can see the results of the tests and quickly identify any failures. This can help you catch issues early on in the development process and make debugging easier.  In terms of recommendations for a small development team, setting up unit testing can be very beneficial. It may take some time to set up initially, but in the long run, it can save you time by catching bugs early and improving the overall quality of your code. It also helps with code maintenance and refactoring as you can quickly verify that your changes have not introduced any new issues.

However, it is important to remember that everyone can have a bad hour or make mistakes, so it is not always a true reflection of a person's capabilities.  In terms of coding, it is important to find a balance between coding the best possible solution and getting the algorithm right. It is fine to first code a workable solution and then refine it until you are satisfied with the result. However, it is also important to pay attention to coding conventions and error handling, as these are important aspects of writing good quality code.  In your case, it sounds like you were on the right track with the Level Order traversal problem, but may have overlooked some details like exception handling and coding conventions. It is always a good idea to double check your code for any errors or improvements before submitting it, as these details can make a big difference in the eyes of the interviewer.  In future interviews, make sure to pay attention to all aspects of coding, including error handling, coding conventions, and any specific requirements given by the interviewer.

I feel that the requirements should be sufficient for giving the information needed for testers to create their tests.

If you are looking for a more significant performance boost, you may want to consider upgrading to a full SSD for your operating system and frequently used applications, while keeping your current HDD for storage of larger files. This would provide a noticeable improvement in overall performance and reduce the lag you are experiencing when opening multiple programs and files simultaneously.  Additionally, upgrading your RAM to at least 4GB or higher would also help improve performance when multitasking and running memory-intensive programs like Visual Studio.

It has been five years since Rails 1.0 was released for Ruby, and since that time we have seen Grails for Groovy, Django for Python, and Roo for Java. But to my knowledge (which is probably limited, being a Java/Groovy progammer) there is no similar framework for C#. Does such a thing exist?  If not, why not? Edit:  It's quite possible I'm not using the right words when I say \"rapid-development,\" but I'm talking about frameworks that can conceivably allow you to build a working blog engine in 30 minutes.  You couldn't reasonably do this with, say, Java, Spring, and Hibernate, given the various configuration needed to allow your controllers to be found, and both configuration and code necessary for your entities to persist and be retrieved.

        "ChatGpt answer": "The concept you are referring to is typically known as a \"full-stack\" web framework, which includes tools and methodologies that streamline the development process and emphasize convention over configuration. Examples of such frameworks include Ruby on Rails, Django, and Grails.  While there may not be a direct equivalent to these frameworks in the C# world, there are some options that provide similar capabilities. One such framework is ASP.NET MVC, which allows developers to quickly build web applications using the Model-View-Controller pattern. Additionally, Microsoft has been investing in Blazor, a framework that allows developers to build interactive web applications using C# and .NET.  One reason why there may not be as many full-stack web frameworks for C# as there are for other languages could be due to the strong ecosystem of tools and libraries available for .NET development. Developers may prefer to mix and match different tools based on their specific needs rather than relying on a single, all-encompassing framework.  Overall, while C# may not have a direct equivalent to Rails or Django, there are still plenty of options available for developers looking to build web applications quickly and efficiently in C#.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "It seems to me that there is no name yet for this kind of framework you are all talking about in this thread. I call them for the moment just RAILS-like Frameworks: Frameworks that increment productivity by orchestrating other existing frameworks with the purpose of solving the basic needs of most web applications, but at the same time hiding all the complexities from the developer. By basic needs I mean the implementation of a Persistence Provider, a Dependency Inyection Container, a Logging tool, an MVC platform, an HTML Template Engine, a Web Site Template Starter Kit with CSS presets, a Security Framework and some Javascript Library for AJAX features and other cool stuff. The RAILS-like Frameworks orchestrate all these frameworks and tools on the basis of the Domain model (the entities of your system with its attributes). Thanks to the Convention-over-Configuration principle, these frameworks avoid the need of defining lots of configuration files usually required by the frameworks they orchestrate (like Spring, Spring MVC, Hibernate, Log4J, etc.), assuming configurations by default based on naming, structure and metadata included in the same classes definitions. Thanks to the dynamic languages that these frameworks make use (like Ruby, Groovy, Python, Clojure, etc.), with the exception of SpringRoo that implements dynamic behaviour in Java by using AspectJ, the functionality that belongs to the frameworks underneath are extended and are made available to the developer in such a uniform and elegant manner that he/she is just aware of the underlying technologies. Finally thanks to the Scaffold technique, unit tests, integration tests, controllers and views are automatically generated for the main functions (CRUD) over each one of the domain objects defined by the developer. In the .NET world nothing has been developed yet, following all the previous definitions. But nothing prevents that from occurring soon. There are great frameworks, tools and libraries already available in the .NET world that can be orchestrated by a new RAILS-like framework made for the CLR. There are Unity, Spring.NET and Castle Windsor among others for the Dependency Inyection needs. Entity Framework 4, NHibernate and iBatis.NET are pretty good .NET Persistence Providers. ASP.NET MVC have strongly arrived with support for various Template Engines besides the traditional ASP.NET. Even if nobody achieves to use a DLR language to build this kind of framework, anyone with enough will can follow the SpringSource path and implement a RAILS-like framework with some static language like F#, C# or VB.NET, making use of an Aspect-Oriented Container (like AspectSharp or Gripper-LOOM.NET) to obtain dynamic behaviour.

I've managed to communicate with people upper the ladder by keeping asking questions that made people face their ignorance, but they won't let me contact the end client since, from his end, it's pretty much a done deal.  The project will soon be over though, and I've decided it's the last time I'll be working under these conditions. The middlemen, are pretty much useless from the perspective of shipping a product, but still necessary to me since they are the ones bringing the contracts in. Hence I'm not thinking about crossing them altogether, which would probably end badly. Rather I'm looking for a way to make them understand I need to be part of the requirements and design process, meet the clients, and shouldn't have to go through a whole channel of clueless people each time I require some information. Sorry for the venting :) Any ideas ? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It sounds like you're in a frustrating situation, but it's great that you're already thinking about how to improve things for future projects. Here are a few suggestions for how you might approach the situation:  1. Keep talking to the upper management: Continue to ask questions and make it clear that you require more direct access to the client in order to be more effective in your work. Demonstrate the benefits of your involvement in the requirements and design process, such as increased efficiency and a higher quality end product.  2. Offer to train the middlemen: If they are clueless about the technical aspects of the project, offer to provide some training or resources to help them better understand the work that you're doing. This may help them see the value in involving you more closely in the process.  3. Suggest a pilot project: If the middlemen are hesitant to change their current process, suggest trying out a pilot project where you are more directly involved in the requirements and design process. This will give them a concrete example of how your involvement can benefit the project.  4. Be prepared to walk away: If the middlemen are unwilling to change their ways and continue to hinder your work, be prepared to walk away from future projects with them. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and professional integrity, and sometimes that means setting boundaries with difficult clients.  Overall, it's important to communicate openly and assertively about your needs and boundaries in order to create a more productive working relationship with the middlemen. Good luck!",

        "Question": "Let me explain this a little. In a previous job, I had a coworker that has a good reputation with the management. He always finished on time. And the bosses were happy with his progress so het got certain privileges. The problem was that the other programmers knew his secret. He has optimized the 80/20 rule, so he worked his 20 percent time to finish 80 percent of the code. The other (hard) 20% was left to the maintenance programmers. Who (not surprisingly) got penalized because of their lack of progress. But because this programmer had a good reputation with the management, it was almost imposible to shift the blame to him. (Fortunately he left the company). My question is, what to do as programming team if you have such a programmer within your team. Do you try to warn management with risk of ruining your own chances? Do you accept the fact? Or are there other options. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It can be difficult to navigate a situation like this, but it is important to address it so that the workload is distributed fairly among the team and everyone is held accountable for their work.   One option is to have a candid conversation with the programmer in question and express your concerns about the situation. This may help them understand the impact of their actions on the team and encourage them to change their behavior.   If that does not work, it may be necessary to bring the issue to management. It is important to approach this conversation tactfully and provide evidence to support your claims. It is possible that management may not be aware of the situation and by bringing it to their attention, they can take appropriate action to address it.   Ultimately, it is important to prioritize the success and wellbeing of the team as a whole. It may be uncomfortable to confront a coworker or speak to management about the issue, but addressing it is necessary to maintain a fair and productive work environment.",

        "Question": "Suppose I develop a useful library and decide to publish it as open source. Some time later I have a business need to do something that wouldn't comply with the open source licence. Am I allowed to do that? How should I publish the software in a way that I keep ownership and don't block myself from using the library in the future in any way? Keep in mind that at least in theory, other developers may decide to contribute to my open-source project. Can I specify in a licence that I as the original developer get ownership of their contributions as well? Don't get me wrong here, I'm not trying to be evil and get ownership of other's work - I just want to keep ownership of mine, and if someone posts an important bugfix I could be rendered unable to use the original code unless I use his work as well. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "When you publish your library as open source, you are essentially giving permission for others to use, modify, and distribute your code according to the terms of the open source license. If you have a business need that doesn't comply with the open source license, you will need to address this carefully.  To protect your ownership and ensure that you do not block yourself from using the library in the future, you may want to consider dual-licensing your software. This means that you release your software under an open source license, but also offer a separate commercial license that allows for additional usage rights that are not covered by the open source license.  When it comes to contributions from other developers, you can specify in the open source license that any contributions to the project are subject to the same license terms as the original project. This means that the contributors retain ownership of their contributions, but they agree to license their contributions under the same license as the original project. This ensures that you can continue to use the original code without any issues related to ownership.  In summary, to maintain ownership of your code and protect your ability to use it in the future, you may want to consider dual-licensing your software and making sure that contributions from other developers are subject to the same license terms as the original project. This will help you maintain control over your code while still benefiting from the contributions of others.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "You always keep ownership under open-source licenses.  The work you created is your property, and you can do whatever you want to with it, (within legal limits, of course,) including allowing other people to use it under the terms of an open-source license.  If you want to use it for a proprietary project, you're welcome to do so, unless you have completely turned over the rights to someone else by contract.  But this is not what open-source licenses do.  They're about sharing usefulness, not about giving up ownership. Things get a bit sticker once other people start contributing.  It's their work, then, not yours, and you need to get their permission.  One thing you can do is publish your library under a dual license.  That's what Sam Lantinga, the primary creator and maintainer of SDL, does.  Because Apple doesn't like dynamic link libraries for iOS, and complying with the LGPL in a statically linked app is more trouble than it's worth, he publishes SDL under both the LGPL and a commercial license for static iPhone apps.  When anyone submits a patch, he explicitly asks them for permission to deploy their patch in the library under both licenses, and if they don't like that, he doesn't add it to the codebase. EDIT: My example is no longer accurate.  A while back Sam changed the model (not sure why; maybe he just got tired of the administration hassles) and now licenses SDL under a highly permissive zlib-style license.  But he used to do it this way. ",

        "Question": "I've only been a year in the industry and I've had some problems making estimates for specific tasks. Before you close this, yes, I've already read this: How to respond when you are asked for an estimate? and that's about the same problem I'm having. But I'm looking for a more specific gauge of experiences, something quantifiable or probably other programmer's average performances which I should aim for and base my estimates.  The answers range from weeks, and I was looking more for an answer on the level of a task assigned for a day or so. (Note that this doesn't include submitting for QA or documentations, just the actual development time from writing tests if I used TDD, to making the page, before having it submitted to testing) My current rate right now is as follows (on ASP.NET webforms):  Right now, I'm able to develop a simple data entry page with a grid listing (no complex logic, just Creating and Reading) on an already built architecture, given one full day's (8 hours) time.   Adding complex functionality, and Update and Delete pages add another full day to the task. If I have to start the page from scratch (no solution, no existing website) it takes me another full day. (Not always) but if I encounter something new or haven't done yet it takes me another full day.  Whenever I make an estimate that's longer than the expected I feel that others think that I'm lagging a lot behind everyone else. I'm just concerned as there have been expectations that when it's just one page it should take me no more than a full day. Yes, there definitely is more room for improvement.  There always is. I have a lot to learn. But I would like to know if my current rate is way too slow, just average, or average for someone no longer than a year in the industry.  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It's great that you are seeking feedback on your performance and looking to improve! It's important to remember that everyone's pace of work is different, and it's okay to take the time you need to deliver quality work. That being said, it's also important to continuously improve and increase your efficiency.  It's hard to say whether your current rate is way too slow, average, or average for someone with only a year of experience, as it can vary greatly from person to person and company to company. However, it seems like you have a good understanding of the time it takes you to complete certain tasks, which is a good start.  One thing you can do to improve is to continue learning and practicing, whether it's through online courses, reading books, or seeking mentorship from more experienced colleagues. You can also try breaking down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks and setting realistic deadlines for each part.  Lastly, communication is key. If you feel like your estimates are not aligning with others' expectations, it's important to communicate early and often about any roadblocks or challenges you may be facing. This can help manage expectations and ensure that everyone is on the same page.  Overall, it's great that you are seeking to improve and grow in your role. Keep learning, practicing, and seeking feedback, and you will continue to excel in your career. Good luck!",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "If you're programming for a job, and your superiors are happy with the rate you're turning stuff out at, then I'd say you're doing fine.  As you've lasted a year, they're clearly not outraged with your output.  Also, you've only been there a year, and assuming they've been managing people for more than a day, they know that there's a learning curve when you're still green. As for estimates... I've been in the industry for 5 years now (certainly not veteran territory, I know!), and my personal estimates still suck.  I overestimate almost as often as I underestimate, and I do both far more than I get it right.  Something will come up, somewhere, and bite you.  Sometimes you'll find a library that does everything you thought you had to do yourself, and a week's work disappears in half a day.  Other times a stupid bug will stretch a day's work out to 2, 3, 4... If you're repeating a lot of the same work over and over, and you feel like you've maxed out your throughput on it, maybe you should ask to be moved to another task. 'Cross-pollination' and other PHB-friendly terms are definitely of benefit to devs.  If you spend a month or more on something else, maybe you'll find something you're better suited to.  If not, or you're not able to stay away from webforms, the change won't do you any harm, and you might come back with a bit more knowledge and experience that will help you. ",

        "Question": "So you take a contract where you have solid experience with 75% of the technology necessary.  How do you handle your time to learn the other 25%? Work it into the billing time?  Expose the 25% in the contract as 'research'?  Do the learning on my own time (not billed)?  Not take the contract (too large of an unknown for me and the customer)? On the extreme end of this, I keep hearing a story about Mark Cuban (Dallas billionaire who started broadcast.com and sold it to Yahoo!) when he was at Indiana University.  Someone asked him if he could build a business app for them and he immediately said \"Yes\"... he had no idea how.  So he bought a book, stayed up nights, studied and coded... He finished it (I'm sure it was ugly), it worked and he kept going. I'm not suggesting doing contracts this way (the stress!), but there's a middle ground.  What is it, and how would you (or would you?) bill for the unknown? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One approach could be to negotiate with the client to allocate a certain percentage of your total time on the project for learning the new technology. This way, you are transparent about your current knowledge level and the client is aware that part of the billing is for your learning curve.   Another option could be to bill for the time spent on learning the new technology separately from the main project work. This way, you are compensated for the time spent on acquiring new skills without impacting the overall project cost.  Alternatively, you could invest your own time outside of billable hours to learn the new technology. This may be a good option if you are confident in your ability to quickly pick up new skills and if the learning curve is not too steep.  In any case, it is important to communicate openly with the client about your current knowledge level and your plan for acquiring the necessary skills. This will help manage expectations and build trust in the client relationship.",

Now, if it's something obscure, I bill for it at my normal rate.  Some examples:  APIs and protocols which are not mainstream (industry specific, small 3rd party or just niche products); internal tools, configuration formats and services inside the client organization; a non-standard database schema, database query language or security model; etc. I've never had any objections about the way I do this, and I'm very transparent about it in my proposals.

If so, what factors are you considering. If you take a real TCO look at large ERP and/or consolidated application landscapes, mainframe is actually quite cost-effective. My own consultations have included recommendations for scale-up/mainframe/mid-size systems on some specific needs.  Honestly, I've never had a customer take said recommendation, rather defaulting to countless scale-out VMs on Intel boxen (in non-trivial cost) and yet still to this day have system management and performance issues. Curious your take on this.  We need to remember that the virtual machines we manage (and apparently love in IT departments) today have been done for decades on mainframe.  Most mid-size and mainframe shops have small fractions of support persons managing larger and more complex applications. Your thoughts appreciated. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "When setting up a system landscape for large and/or multiple application deployments, it is definitely important to consider mainframe as an option. Mainframes have been around for a long time and are known for their reliability, scalability, and security.   One key factor to consider when looking at mainframes is the total cost of ownership (TCO). While the upfront cost of a mainframe may be higher than that of a traditional server infrastructure, when you take into account factors such as maintenance, energy consumption, and personnel costs, mainframes can actually be quite cost-effective in the long run.  In addition, mainframes are known for their performance capabilities and can handle large workloads efficiently. This can be a critical factor when deploying large ERP systems or other consolidated applications that require high levels of processing power.  It is interesting to note that many organizations still default to using scale-out VMs on Intel servers, even when a mainframe may be a more suitable option. This is likely due to a lack of understanding or familiarity with mainframe technology, as well as a perception that mainframes are outdated or overly complex.  In reality, mainframes offer a level of system management and performance that is hard to beat, with smaller support teams able to manage larger and more complex applications. Overall, it is important for organizations to consider mainframes as a viable option when setting up their system landscapes, especially for large and demanding workloads.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "It seems to me that you're doing more to express your opinion (\"If you take a real TCO look at large ERP and/or consolidated application landscapes, mainframe is actually quite cost-effective.\") than really ask a question. On that basis, I'm tempted to vote to close, but won't. As for the question (to the extent there is one), I'm going to assume that by \"mainframe\", you mean something like an IBM z series machine, rather than (for example) one of the big Fujitsu SPARC boxes. I think for many people, it's hard to recommend mainframes for a couple of reasons.   Every vendor has TCO numbers to \"prove\" their product is the best. Why should somebody trust numbers from IBM more than from Microsoft, Oracle, etc? Even if a mainframe really would make sense, such a recommendation is unlikely to be taken seriously, and whoever made such a recommendation will often be treated as a pariah. Even if the TCO would theoretically work out better in some respects, introducing machines with which existing staff are thoroughly unfamiliar would often be a mistake anyway. Using a mainframe would often lose versatility in other ways. Just for example, an Intel box can easily run Windows Terminal Server to make Word and Excel available, which is a bit tougher to do with a mainframe.  ",

Most of the time, I find myself juggling with at least 2 projects, in addition to the numerous websites I have to upkeep and perform maintenance on.

        "ChatGpt answer": "One way to handle these situations is to set clear expectations with your clients from the beginning. Make sure they understand the scope of the project, the timeline for completion, and the amount of work that will be involved. Communicate regularly with your clients so they are aware of the progress being made and any potential delays.  It is also important to prioritize your tasks and projects. Make a list of what needs to be done and organize it based on deadlines and importance. Focus on completing one task at a time rather than trying to juggle multiple projects simultaneously.  Additionally, consider outsourcing some of the work to other programmers or freelancers if you are feeling overwhelmed. This can help lighten your workload and allow you to focus on the most critical tasks.  Lastly, don't be afraid to set boundaries with your clients.

Speed of the web interface is a priority for this project, second only to security. In the past, we've always created \"web sites\" in Visual Studio, which, when published, results in one dll and one aspx file for each page within the system. However, I am aware that you can actually create a \"web application\" and have it compile everything down to a single dll. To me (based on no real data, just gut feeling), compiling the site as a single dll sounds like it would be better for both security and speed (if only marginally).

        "ChatGpt answer": "When considering whether to create a web site or a web application for your project, there are several factors to take into account:  1. Performance: As you mentioned, compiling the site into a single DLL could potentially improve the performance of the web interface as it reduces the number of separate files that need to be loaded. However, the actual impact on performance may vary depending on the size and complexity of your project.  2. Security: While having all code compiled into a single DLL may make it harder for malicious users to access or tamper with individual files, it is not a guaranteed security measure. Security should still be a top priority, regardless of whether you choose a web site or web application.  3. Ease of deployment and maintenance: Web applications are typically easier to deploy and maintain, as all code is compiled into a single DLL. This can make it simpler to update the application across multiple client sites.  4. Development workflow: Consider how your team is used to working and whether a web site or web application aligns with your current development practices. Web sites may offer more flexibility in terms of adding and updating individual files, while web applications enforce a more structured development process.  5. Scalability: If you anticipate the need to scale your project in the future, consider whether a web site or web application would be better suited for handling increased traffic and user load.  In terms of potential pitfalls, be aware that converting an existing web site to a web application may require some effort and testing to ensure that everything works correctly.

Try to involve them in the decision-making process for tech-related projects so they have a better understanding of the challenges involved.  Also, don't be afraid to reach out to others in your network or online communities for support and advice. It can be helpful to connect with other tech professionals who understand your position and can offer insights or solutions to common challenges.  Overall, it's important to find a balance between being the 'tech guy' and still feeling connected to the rest of the company. Keep advocating for yourself and your role within the organization, and hopefully, you can find a way to make your position more fulfilling and less isolating.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Take advantage of the situation you have - to a certain extent, I think you have a little bit of \"grassisgreeneritis\".  Sorry, I'm not trying to be funny.  What I am saying is every position at every company has short-comings.  Yours are starting to get to you more because they are very familiar.  But, at tech companies, schedules and time commitments become an issue.  At larger non-tech companies, overcoming political stupidity and procedure can be big issues. So take advantage of what you have now; learn what you can.  Once you believe you can't really learn more, it is probably time to move on.  There is no harm in that; it sounds like you are one of those people that have to grow to be happy with a job. Your current company should understand that when you reach that point and honestly, if they don't, leaving is definitely the right thing to do. Having said all that, there is more you can do in your current position.   If you are feeling solitary, make some changes to eliminate that feeling.    Use on-line communities to bounce ideas off of people (StackOverflow is great for this). Do some research with Google to find out what it would take to land your company first and then put a proposal together to get it to happen.   When going through projects, take the initiative and change how things happen.  Don't go for the impractical, long projects. Instead, propose month long incremental improvements.  Over a year, those add up and can really help you feel like you've accomplished something.   ",

        "Question": "I have found that there are only 3 ways to unit test (mock/stub) dependencies that are static in C#.NET:  Moles TypeMock JustMock  Given that two of these are not free and one has not hit release 1.0, mocking static stuff is not too easy. Does that make static methods and such \"evil\" (in the unit testing sense)?  And if so, why does resharper want me to make anything that can be static, static? (Assuming resharper is not also \"evil\".) Clarification: I am talking about the scenario when you want to unit test a method and that method calls a static method in a different unit/class.  By most definitions of unit testing, if you just let the method under test call the static method in the other unit/class then you are not unit testing, you are integration testing.  (Useful, but not a unit test.) ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Static methods and dependencies can indeed make unit testing more difficult, as they can make it harder to isolate the code under test. In traditional unit testing, it is preferred to mock or stub dependencies in order to isolate the code being tested and ensure that the test is focused solely on that code.  That being said, static methods themselves are not inherently \"evil\" in the unit testing sense. They can still be useful in certain situations, such as providing utility functions or encapsulating logic that does not require external dependencies.  As for ReSharper suggesting that you make things static, it is likely trying to promote best practices in terms of code organization and performance. Static methods can sometimes be more efficient and easier to call than instance methods, especially for utility functions that do not rely on instance data. However, it is important to consider the trade-offs in terms of testability and maintainability when deciding whether to make a method static.  Ultimately, the decision of whether to use static methods and dependencies should be based on the specific context and requirements of your project. If testability is a priority, you may want to consider alternative approaches such as dependency injection or refactoring to make the code more modular and easier to test.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Looking at the other answers here, I think there might be some confusion between static methods that hold static state or cause side-effects (which sounds to me like a really bad idea), and static methods that merely return a value.   Static methods which hold no state and cause no side effects should be easily unit testable.  In fact, I consider such methods a \"poor-man's\" form of functional programming; you hand the method an object or value, and it returns an object or value.  Nothing more.  I don't see how such methods would negatively affect unit testing at all. ",

        "Question": "A well-tested codebase has a number of benefits, but testing certain aspects of the system results in a codebase that is resistant to some types of change. An example is testing for specific output--e.g., text or HTML. Tests are often (naively?) written to expect a particular block of text as output for some input parameters, or to search for specific sections in a block.  Changing the behavior of the code, to meet new requirements or because usability testing has resulted in change to the interface, requires changing the tests as well--perhaps even tests that are not specifically unit tests for the code being changed.  How do you manage the work of finding and rewriting these tests? What if you can't just \"run 'em all and let the framework sort them out\"? What other sorts of code-under-test result in habitually fragile tests?  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Managing the work of finding and rewriting tests that are overly specific to output can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can be employed to help make this process more manageable.  One approach is to regularly review and refactor tests to ensure they are not overly reliant on specific output. This can involve creating helper functions or utilities that abstract away the details of the output, allowing tests to focus on the behavior of the code rather than the specific output it generates.  Another approach is to use more flexible testing techniques, such as property-based testing or snapshot testing. Property-based testing involves defining properties that the output of a function should satisfy, rather than expecting a specific output. Snapshot testing involves capturing the output of a function and comparing it to a previously saved \"snapshot\" of the output, allowing changes to be easily detected and reviewed.  In terms of other types of code-under-test that can result in habitually fragile tests, any code that has tight coupling with external dependencies or complex, untestable logic can be difficult to write stable tests for. This can include code that relies heavily on external APIs, databases, or frameworks, as well as code that has complex branching logic or side effects that make it difficult to isolate and test in a controlled environment. In these cases, it may be necessary to refactor the code to make it more testable or to use mocking or stubbing techniques to isolate the code under test from its dependencies.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I know the TDD folks will hate this answer, but a large part of it for me is to choose carefully where to test something. If I go too crazy with unit tests in the lower tiers then no meaningful change can be made without altering the unit tests.  If the interface is never exposed and not intended to be reused outside the app then this is just needless overhead to what might have been a quick change otherwise. Conversely if what you are trying to change is exposed or re-used every one of those tests you are going to have to change is evidence of something you might be breaking elsewhere. In some projects this may amount to designing your tests from the acceptance tier down rather than from the unit tests up. and having fewer unit tests and more integration style tests. It does not mean that you cannot still identify a single feature and code until that feature meets its acceptance criteria.  It simply means that in some cases you do not end up measuring the acceptance criteria with unit tests. ",

        "Question": "To the outside world, programmers, computer scientists, software engineers, and developers may all seem alike, but that's far from the case for the people who create software for a living.  Any single programmer's ability and knowledge can range very widely, as well as their tools (OS, language, and yes, preferred editor), and that diversity spawns many sub-cultures in software - like programmers who actively use Stack Overflow and this site, versus many more who don't. I'm curious to hear from others what software sub-cultures they've encountered, belonged to, admired, disliked, or even created.  For starters, I've encountered:  Microsoft-driven companies and developers: their entire stack is from Redmond, WA.  E-mail is Outlook is e-mail.  The web is IE and IIS.  They have large binders of their MS Developer Network subscription full of multiple versions of VB, .net, Visual Studio, etc.  Avoids working with a shell/command-line.  Don't see what the fuss with open-source and such is all about.  MS-centric companies tend to be 9-5 and quite corporate (driven by business managers, not software people). Nowadays (given the wide availability of non-MS tools), this is the antithesis of hacker culture. Old-school CS people: they often know Lisp and Unix extremely well; sometimes, they may have written a semi-popular Lisp themselves, or a system utility. Few, if any, \"software engineering\" things are new to them, nor are they impressed by such.  Know the references, history, and higher-level implications of programming languages like Lisp, C, Prolog, and Smalltalk.  Can be bitter about AI outcomes of the 80's and 90's. Tend to be Emacs users.  Can type out multi-line shell commands without blinking an eye.  Their advice can by cryptic, but contains gold once understood. New-school web developers: played with computers and video games growing up, but often only really started programming in the late '90s or early '00's.  Comfortable with 1 to 1.5 scripting/dynamic languages; think C and languages outside of Ruby/Perl/Python are unnecessary/magical.  May have considered HTML as programming initially.  Tend to get a Mac and be fanatical/irrational about it.  Use frameworks more than build them.  Often overly-enthusiastic about NoSQL and/or Ruby On Rails. New-school CS: lots of training in statistics, Bayesian models and inference; don't say \"AI,\" say \"machine learning.\" More Java than Lisp, but could also be expert Haskell programmers.  Seeing major real-world successes by experts in their field (Google, finance/quants) often makes them (over) confident.  But big data, and the distributed processing of such, really are changing the world.  The examples above are by no means complete, correct, orthogonal, or objective. :)  Just what I've seen personally, and provided to spark some discussion and outline of the broader question.

        "Question": "A lot of us started seeing this phenomenon with jQuery about a year ago when people started asking how to do absolutely insane things like retrieve the query string with jQuery.  The difference between the library (jQuery) and the language (JavaScript) is apparently lost on many programmers, and results in a lot of inappropriate, convoluted code being written where it is not necessary. Maybe it's just my imagination, but I swear I'm starting to see an uptick in the number of questions where people are asking to do similarly insane things with Linq, like find ranges in a sorted array.  I can't get over how thoroughly inappropriate the Linq extensions are for solving that problem, but more importantly the fact that the author just assumed that the ideal solution would involve Linq without actually thinking about it (as far as I can tell).  It seems that we are repeating history, breeding a new generation of .NET programmers who can't tell the difference between the language (C#/VB.NET) and the library (Linq). What is responsible for this phenomenon?  Is it just hype?  Magpie tendencies?  Has Linq picked up a reputation as a form of magic, where instead of actually writing code you just have to utter the right incantation?  I'm hardly satisfied with those explanations but I can't really think of anything else. More importantly, is it really a problem, and if so, what's the best way to help enlighten these people? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It could be a combination of factors that contribute to this phenomenon. One possible reason is that as developers, we are always looking for easier and quicker ways to solve problems. Linq offers a more concise and readable way to manipulate data in C# or VB.NET, so it may seem like a magic solution to some developers who are not familiar with the underlying concepts.  Another reason could be the lack of proper education or training in the fundamentals of programming. If developers are not taught the difference between the language and the libraries they are using, they may not realize when they are using a tool inappropriately.  To help enlighten these developers, it may be helpful to provide more education and training on the fundamentals of programming, as well as the specific language and libraries they are using. Encouraging them to dive deeper into the documentation and understand how things work under the hood can also help prevent the misuse of tools like Linq. Mentorship and code reviews can also be valuable in guiding developers towards more efficient and appropriate solutions to their problems.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "It's basically because programming is fundamentally difficult.  It requires a lot of logical, structured thought in a way that a lot of people just don't know how to do.  (Or simply can't do, depending on who you listen to.) Stuff like LINQ and jQuery makes certain common data-manipulation tasks a whole lot easier.  That's great for those of us who know what we're doing, but the unfortunate side effect is that it lowers the bar. It makes it easier for people who have no idea what they're doing to start writing code and make things work.  And then when they run into reality, and find something fundamentally difficult that their simple, high-abstraction-level techniques are not well suited to, they're lost, because they don't understand the platform that their library is built upon. Your question is sort of on the right track, but much like the perennial controversy about violent video games \"turning kids violent,\" it has the direction of the link backwards.

        "Question": "There are some really common usability errors in everyday software we used; errors that result from the ways the particular programmer has learned without learning of all the other ways there are. For example, talking about Windows software in particular, the following common flaws come to mind:  Failure to support multiple screens. For example, windows centered in the virtual desktop (instead of a specific screen) and hence displayed spanning the monitor boundary in a dual monitor setup. Failure to support serious keyboard users. For example, utterly messed up tab order; duplicate or completely missing accelerator keys. Alt+Tab order mess-ups. For example, a window that doesn't go to the end of the tab order when minimized. Subtle breakage of common controls that were reimplemented for one reason or another. E.g. failure to implement Ctrl+Left/Right on a textbox; failure to add an Alt+Space window menu to a skinnable window, failure to make Ctrl+Insert copy to clipboard, etc, etc. This one is a huge category in its own right.  There are a gazillion of things like this. How can we ever make sure we don't break a large proportion of these? After all they aren't all written down anywhere... or are they? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One way to prevent these common usability errors is to follow established design guidelines and best practices. There are many resources available, such as Microsoft's Design Guidelines for Windows and the Apple Human Interface Guidelines, that provide recommendations on how to design user-friendly software.  Additionally, conducting usability testing with actual users can help identify potential issues before software is released. By observing how users interact with the software and listening to their feedback, developers can gain valuable insights into areas that may need improvement.  Lastly, staying informed about new developments in user interface design and regularly updating software to incorporate the latest design trends can help ensure that usability errors are minimized. It's also important for developers to continue learning and expanding their knowledge of different design patterns and techniques to create software that is intuitive and user-friendly.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I think one thing to keep in mind is to remember the source reason for most software usability problems \u2014 usability is a human issue, and as such, is difficult to define with a set of rules.  This is totally at odds with the rules-world that most programmers want to live in. Because of that I think you need to throw out the belief that a checklist of usability problems could ever be helpful.  Believing that is thinking like a programmer and will only result in more usability problems that you simply hadn't thought of (or that are the result of sticking to a usability \"rule\" that never really should have been a rule).  One of the biggest differences can be made by designing first (read Alan Cooper's The Inmates are Running the Asylum). Second, make sure your software goes through usability testing with real users. Third, don't think like a programmer. The possible idea in your question is a perfect example of why this is important to remember.  Even good ideas (avoiding non-standard controls) are not always going to hold true.  Those controls may be faulty themselves or may be used for something they shouldn't.  The perfect solution for your form or user input may not have been invented yet, or may simply be not widely used or implemented (the iPhone is a great case study for this).  As another illustration of the problem with \"usability checklists\", the list you presented may well be common to you, and I agree they are problems, but I hadn't really thought of most of them prior to reading your list.  On the other hand, I've experienced tons of annoyances with Windows since being given a PC for my day-job:  (Windows 7) Mousing over a task bar button and then over a Window thumbnail drops all other windows to just outlines.  I've done this by accident a number of times and had what I was reading simply disappear. The Alt+tab pane can now be moused over to temporarily bring the window to the front.  However, when you let go you think it's going to stay there, and it doesn't. (MS Outlook - I know, sort of a cheap shot) If I open a new email and then close it, even if I haven't added any text it asks me if I want to save the draft.

Its filter sets cover outdated PHP exploits, and I have to rewrite my stuff because Wordpress&Co had bugs years ago.   Does this happen to anyone else?  Apache mod_security blocks possibly   dangerous HTTP requests before they   reach applications (PHP specifically).   It uses various filter sets, mostly   regex based.  So I have a nice shared hosting provider, technically apt and stuff. But this bugged me: Just last week I had to change a parameter name &src= in one of my apps because mod_security blocks ANY requests with that. I didn't look up its details, but this filter rule was preventing the exploitability of another app which I don't use and probably never had heard about. Still I had to rewrite my code (renaming parameter often suffices to trick mod_security) which had nothing to do or in common with that! And today, a silly regex blocks form submissions, because I wanted to submit php sample code. Given, this is the simple stuff that mod_security is there to protect against. But I don't believe mod_security can detect seriously obfuscated code, and just goes off at obvious (and in this case totally trivial) php snippets. Basically I'm getting penalized by mod_security because other people released bug-prone apps. (Not saying my apps are ultra secure - I'm pretty security wary, but make no hyperbolic claims.) I've already asked my provider to disable it anyway, the benefits are too minuscle IMO and for my apps.  What do you think? Does mod_security make much sense outside of WP hosting? Or is it really just a bunch of blacklists of long passed security bugs? Which of its rules are actually helpful? Is there an application level equivalent? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It sounds like you're experiencing frustration with mod_security blocking legitimate requests in your applications. Mod_security can be a useful tool for protecting against known vulnerabilities, but it can also be overly aggressive at times.  In terms of whether mod_security makes sense outside of WordPress hosting, it really depends on the specific use case. For some applications, the added protection that mod_security provides may be worth the occasional inconvenience of false positives. However, for other applications where security is a lower priority, disabling mod_security may be a viable option.  As for helpful rules in mod_security, it's difficult to say without knowing the specific filter sets that your provider is using. Some rules may be more effective at catching legitimate threats, while others may be more prone to false positives.  In terms of an application-level equivalent to mod_security, there are various security tools and practices that can be implemented to protect against vulnerabilities. This includes input validation, proper error handling, and regular security audits. It's important to strike a balance between security measures and usability to ensure that your applications remain secure without overly impeding functionality.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I personally see mod_security as a patch. I use it on some of our servers where we can't control the code that's uploaded (shared hosting servers, for example), but it's never really felt like a good solution to me. Based on it's wide and very general blacklist approach, it's more of a patch to cover up security holes than a good security policy. It can also provide a false sense of security. mod_security can reveal some common attacks but can by no means prevent any attack. Again, it's a blacklist of common known attacks. If you simply install mod_security and think that you're magically secure, you're horribly mistaken. I have found a much better policy to me managed servers where my team reviews all code that is placed on them, combined with lots of logs, logfile analysis, reporting systems, and intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IPS). Everytime third-party or open-source software is installed (I'm looking at you, WordPress!) we keep a log of where it was installed, and when new versions are released we update every copy that was installed. Again, you're more likely to find mod_security on a shared hosting server, as you're experiencing now. As you grow you can move to a VPS or clod based hosting provider where you get your own managed environment and can more tightly control the available software. ",

However, there are certain cases where it may be appropriate to implement some logic in the database layer. For example, if you have complex queries that need to be executed frequently, it may be more efficient to store them as stored procedures in the database. Additionally, triggers can be useful for enforcing data integrity and maintaining consistency in the database.   That being said, it is important to strike a balance and not overuse triggers and stored procedures in the database layer.

And that's not good when I want to convince my superiors to support my rewrite. (I work in a fairly small company so the proposal has the possibility of being approved) TL;DR When is a big rewrite the answer and what arguments can you use to support it? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Deciding when a big rewrite is the answer can be a complex decision and will depend on a variety of factors specific to your situation. Here are some arguments you can use to support your proposal for a rewrite:  1. Technical Debt: The current codebase is riddled with technical debt, making it difficult to maintain, extend, and add new features. The cost of continuing to work with the existing code may outweigh the cost of a rewrite.  2. Inefficiency: The current application may be inefficient, leading to slow performance, high resource usage, and user frustration. A rewrite could improve the application's performance and usability.  3. Opportunities for Improvement: A rewrite provides the opportunity to refactor the codebase, make use of modern technologies and best practices, and implement a more structured and maintainable architecture.  4. Business Value: A rewrite could bring significant long-term benefits to the business, such as increased productivity, reduced maintenance costs, improved scalability, and enhanced user experience.  5. Strategic Alignment: The rewrite aligns with the company's long-term goals and vision for the application. It positions the company for future growth and success.  It's important to carefully weigh the potential benefits against the risks and challenges of a big rewrite. Consider factors such as the resources required, the timeline for completion, the impact on ongoing operations, and the potential for disruptions. Communicate your proposal clearly and thoroughly to your superiors, making a compelling case for why a rewrite is the best course of action for the company.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Sorry, this is going to be long, but it's based on personal experience as both architect and developer on multiple rewrite projects. The following conditions should cause you to consider some sort of rewrite.  I'll talk about how to decide which one to do after that.  Developer ramp-up time is very high.  If it takes any longer than below (by experience level) to ramp up a new developer, then the system needs to be redesigned.  By ramp-up time, I mean the amount of time before the new developer is ready to do their first commit (on a small feature)   Fresh out of college - 1.5 months Still green, but have worked on other projects before - 1 month Mid level - 2 weeks Experienced - 1 week Senior level - 1 day  Deployment cannot be automated, because of the complexity of the existing architecture Even simple bug fixes take too long because of the complexity of existing code New features take too long, and cost too much because of the interdependence of the codebase (new features cannot be isolated, and therefore affect existing features) The formal testing cycle takes too long because of the interdependence of the existing codebase. Too many use cases are executed on too few screens. This causes training issues for the users and developers. The technology that the current system is in demands it   Quality developers with experience in the technology are too hard to find It is deprecated (It can't be upgraded to support newer platforms/features) There is simply a much more expressive higher-level technology available The cost of maintaining the infrastructure of the older technology is too high   These things are pretty self-evident. When to decide on a complete rewrite versus an incremental rebuild is more subjective, and therefore more politically charged. What I can say with conviction is that to categorically state that it is never a good idea is wrong. If a system can be incrementally redesigned, and you have the full support of project sponsorship for such a thing, then you should do it.  Here's the problem, though. Many systems cannot be incrementally redesigned. Here are some of the reasons I have encountered that prevent this (both technical and political).  Technical   The coupling of components is so high that changes to a single component cannot be isolated from other components.  A redesign of a single component results in a cascade of changes not only to adjacent components, but indirectly to all components. The technology stack is so complicated that future state design necessitates multiple infrastructure changes. This would be necessary in a complete rewrite as well, but if it's required in an incremental redesign, then you lose that advantage. Redesigning a component results in a complete rewrite of that component anyway, because the existing design is so fubar that there's nothing worth saving. Again, you lose the advantage if this is the case.  Political   The sponsors cannot be made to understand that an incremental redesign requires a long-term commitment to the project. Inevitably, most organizations lose the appetite for the continuing budget drain that an incremental redesign creates. This loss of appetite is inevitable for a rewrite as well, but the sponsors will be more inclined to continue, because they don't want to be split between a partially complete new system and a partially obsolete old system. The users of the system are too attached with their \"current screens.\" If this is the case, you won't have the license to improve a vital part of the system (the front-end). A redesign lets you circumvent this problem, since they're starting with something new. They'll still insist on getting \"the same screens,\" but you have a little more ammunition to push back.   Keep in mind that the total cost of redesiging incrementally is always higher than doing a complete rewrite, but the impact to the organization is usually smaller.  In my opinion, if you can justify a rewrite, and you have superstar developers, then do it. Only do it if you can be certain that there is the political will to see it through to completion.  This means both executive and end user buy-in.  Without it, you will fail. I'm assuming that this is why Joel says it's a bad idea.  Executive and end-user buy-in looks like a two-headed unicorn to many architects. You have to sell it aggressively, and campaign for its continuation continuously until it's complete.  That's difficult, and you're talking about staking your reputation on something that some will not want to see succeed. Some strategies for success:  If you do, however, do not try to convert existing code. Design the system from scratch. Otherwise you're wasting your time. I have never seen or heard of a \"conversion\" project that didn't end up miserably. Migrate users to the new system one team at a time. Identify the teams that have the MOST pain with the existing system, and migrate them first. Let them spread the good news by word of mouth. This way your new system will be sold from within. Design your framework as you need it. Don't start with some I-spent-6-months-building-this framework that has never seen real code. Keep your technology stack as small as possible. Don't over-design. You can add technologies as needed, but taking them out is difficult. Additionally, the more layers you have, the more work it is for developers to do things. Don't make it difficult from the get-go. Involve the users directly in the design process, but don't let them dictate how to do it. Earn their trust by showing them that you can give them what they want better if you follow good design principles.  ",

I've been met with unexpected success, and the workflow differs from anything I've ever experienced. My findings:  It's fun to fight over code, but also very satisfying to collaborate on it in real time. Two people can work collaboratively or separately, and be constantly aware of each other's changes. The comments end up becoming a free-form IM conversation about the code around them. The medium is enormously less restrictive than trying to work back and forth over IM proper. It's like pair programming, but with no overhead to switch roles between driver and navigator.  Has anyone tried this before? What were some of the advantages and problems that you encountered? For those that haven't tried it, I strongly encourage you to find a friend (or two, or more!) and make an attempt.

It also helped us catch mistakes quickly and discuss different approaches to solving problems.  One problem that we encountered was figuring out who should take the lead and make changes, as we both wanted to contribute equally. We had to establish some ground rules and communicate effectively to avoid stepping on each other's toes.

Short sharing the same terminal, each sharing a separate terminal (her read/my write, her write, my read).

        "Question": "Prevalence is a simple technique to provide ACID properties to an in-memory object model based on binary serialization and write-ahead logging.  It works like this:  Start with a snapshot.  Serialize the object model and write it to a file. Create a journal file.  For every call into the object model, serialize the call and its arguments. When the journal gets too big, you're shutting down, or it's otherwise convenient, perform a checkpoint: write a new snapshot and truncate the journal. To roll back or recover from a crash or power hit, load the last snapshot and re-execute all the calls recorded in the journal.  The precautions needed to make this work are:  Don't let mutable object references escape or enter the prevalence layer.  You need some sort of proxy or OID scheme, as if you were doing RPC.  (This is such a common newbie mistake it's been nicknamed the 'baptism problem'.) All the logic reachable from a call must be completely deterministic, and must not perform business-logic-meaningful I/O or OS calls.  Writing to a diagnostic log is probably OK, but getting the system time or launching an asynchronous delegate is generally not.  This is so that the journal replays identically even if it's restored on a different machine or at a different time.  (Most prevalence code provides an alternate time call to get the transaction timestamp.) Writer concurrency introduces ambiguity in journal interpretation, so it is prohibited.  Is it because ...  people developed a bad taste for them after trying to use one on a project that wasn't well suited* to it?   Klaus Wuestefeld's strident advocacy turned people off? people who like the imperative programming model dislike separating I/O from calculation, preferring instead to interleave computation with I/O and threading calls? prevalence layers are so conceptually simple and so intimately bound to the characteristics of the framework they inhabit that they're usually custom-rolled for the project, which makes them too alien/nonstandard/risky? it's just too hard to keep straight what you have to be careful not to do? newbies' heads just seem to explode when faced with something that isn't the same kind of two-tier database-driven app they learned to write in school? ;)   *The entire data set fits in RAM, you don't need writer concurrency, and you don't need to do ad-hoc queries, reporting, or export to a data warehouse.  With apologies to SQLite, prevalence is an improvement on save-files, not a replacement for Oracle. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There could be a combination of reasons why prevalence is not more widely adopted, including a lack of understanding or familiarity with the concept, the perceived complexity or difficulty of implementing and maintaining a prevalence layer, and the limitations of prevalence in certain contexts.

It means I'm no longer working with my database (mysql) and any mysql-specific features are gone, out the window, like they don't exist. The idea the ORM has is that it's trying to help me by making everything database agnostic. This sounds great, but often there is a reason why I choose a specific database system. But by going the database agnostic route, the ORM takes the lowest common denominator, which means I end up with the smallest set of features (the ones supported by all databases).  What if I know that for the long term I won't be switching the underlying database? Why not access the database-specific features, too? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "While it may be frustrating to lose access to specific database features by using an ORM, there are still ways to work around this limitation.   One option is to use custom SQL queries or raw SQL within your ORM to access those database-specific features when needed. Most ORMs allow you to execute raw SQL queries, giving you the flexibility to utilize database-specific functionality when necessary.   Another option is to implement database-specific functionality outside of the ORM layer, such as in stored procedures, triggers, or views within the database itself. This allows you to take advantage of the features of your chosen database system without having to sacrifice the benefits of the ORM.  Ultimately, the decision to use an ORM and sacrifice access to database-specific features is a trade-off that must be weighed based on the priorities and requirements of your project. If the benefits of using an ORM outweigh the limitations, it may still be the right choice for your application.

Request a meeting with the sales team: Ask for a dedicated meeting with the sales team to discuss your concerns in detail and brainstorm potential solutions together. This can help facilitate open communication and collaboration to address the issues at hand.  4. Set boundaries: Make it clear that you have other tasks and responsibilities that need your attention, and prioritize those over futile efforts on doomed projects. Setting boundaries can help you avoid being pulled into unproductive discussions and allow you to focus on more meaningful work.  5. Follow up in writing: After the meeting or discussion, follow up in writing with a summary of the key points discussed, including your concerns, recommendations, and any action items agreed upon. This can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and provide a record of the communication for future reference.

And can you make another demo by then? It's just never going to be an appropriate response for you to say \"dude, Mr Big is totally not buying this software, that meeting would waste my time, no, I'm not going.\" Whether Mr Big is buying or not is something the sales guy is supposed to know more about than you.

Longer term, a chat with your boss about this \"supporting the sales team\" role would probably be helpful. Is your issue the time spent? Or that you object to investing time in something that is doomed? In my experience, it is highly unusual for the number of technical people in the room to shrink as the sales process goes on - normally the tech people only show up once things are getting warm, and more of them come to each meeting until the client is landed. So you wanting to bail from the process before the sale is closed will appear strange to management and sales. Discussing this with management may help you to understand how your presence increases the chance of a sale. I think it's unlikely management will grant you a pass to bail on selected client pitches based on your opinion of whether they are going to buy or not, but you could talk about it. Finally, you clearly are expected to produce slides and demos as part of your job, so approach them with the same dignity as \"real code\". Reuse, have a repository, be modular, don't repeat yourself, figure out how to waste as little time as possible giving sales what they need.

        "ChatGpt answer": "One way to avoid anomalies like this is to use transactions. In the context of a database or web service, a transaction ensures that all operations within it either succeed or fail together. This means that if someone transfers money from one account to another, both operations will only be committed if they are successful.   In the example given, if you were to query the total amount of money in both accounts within a transaction, then the transfer of money from Checking to Savings would not affect the results until the transaction is complete. This ensures that you get a consistent view of the data at a specific point in time.   Using transactions can help maintain data integrity and prevent inconsistencies or anomalies in cases where multiple operations need to be performed in order to get the desired information. It's important to make sure that all critical operations are performed within a transaction, especially in scenarios involving financial transactions or sensitive data.",

Some possible solutions in your example:  Ensure that the service can return both Savings and Checking figures in a single query, perhaps as a Total. Implement some kind of session so that the user requesting values can lock the data until she has finished reading all the values in which she is interested. This approach is often called \"pessimistic concurrency control\". Design the service so that you can pass your previous Checking figure back when you request a Savings figure. If the Checking figure no longer matches its previous value, the service should indicate an error rather than return a value for Savings. This approach is a variation of \"optomistic concurrency control\".  ",

Some programmers see value in staying up to date on the latest technologies and best practices through books, while others prefer to learn through hands-on experience or online resources.  Ultimately, whether or not programmers read programming-related books may come down to personal preference and learning style.

Sifting through the open-source projects on various sites to help out on is excruciating (5 hrs down the tubes so far - not worth the trouble)  I'm not looking for a specific suggestion for what to work on because that would be a terribly hard task. I don't think that here knows nearly enough about eachother to effectively give good suggestions. So I ask, is there any mental exercise that you use to decide what to make when you're not \"fiddlin'\"? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One approach you could take is to think about your hobbies, interests, or daily activities, and try to identify any pain points or areas where software could make your life easier or more enjoyable. For example, if you enjoy cooking, you could create a recipe management app. If you like gardening, you could build a plant care tracker. If you enjoy reading, you could develop a book recommendation tool.   Another approach is to think about the skills or technologies you want to learn or improve upon, and create a project that will help you achieve that goal. For example, if you want to get better at frontend development, you could build a simple website or web app. If you want to learn about machine learning, you could work on a project that involves analyzing data or creating predictive models.  Ultimately, the key is to choose a project that you're excited about and that will challenge you in a way that aligns with your goals and interests. Once you have a clear idea of what you want to build, you can start brainstorming and planning out the details of the project. Good luck!",

        "Question": "Note: this question is an edited excerpt from a blog posting I wrote a few months ago.  After placing a link to the blog in a comment on Programmers.SE someone requested that I post a question here so that they could answer it.  This posting is my most popular, as people seem to type \"I don't get object-oriented programming\" into Google a lot.  Feel free to answer here, or in a comment at Wordpress.  What is object-oriented programming?    No one has given me a satisfactory   answer.  I feel like you will not get   a good definition from someone who   goes around saying \u201cobject\u201d and   \u201cobject-oriented\u201d with his nose in the   air. Nor will you get a good   definition from someone who has done   nothing but object-oriented   programming. No one who understands   both procedural and object-oriented   programming has ever given me a   consistent idea of what an   object-oriented program actually does.  Can someone please give me their ideas of the advantages of object-oriented programming? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of \"objects\", which are essentially instances of classes. Objects encapsulate data and behavior, allowing for the creation of reusable and modular code.   One of the key advantages of object-oriented programming is the concept of inheritance, which allows for the creation of new classes based on existing classes, thus promoting code reusability and reducing redundancy.   Another advantage is the ability to model real-world entities more accurately, making it easier to understand and maintain the code. Additionally, object-oriented programming promotes encapsulation, which helps in organizing and managing code by hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary interfaces.   Moreover, polymorphism in object-oriented programming allows for a single interface to be used for entities of different types, increasing flexibility and extensibility of the code.   Overall, object-oriented programming provides a systematic way of organizing and structuring code, making it easier to build and maintain complex software systems.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "From your blog, it seems that you're familiar with both imperative and functional programming, and that you're familiar with the basic concepts involved in object-oriented programming, but you've just never really had it \"click\" as to what makes it useful.  I'll try to explain in terms of that knowledge, and hope that it's helpful to you. At its core, OOP is a way to use the imperative paradigm to better manage high degrees of complexity by creating \"smart\" data structures that model the problem domain.  In a (standard procedural non-object-oriented) program, you've got two basic things: variables, and code that knows what to do with them.  The code takes input from the user and various other sources, stores it in variables, operates on it, and produces output data which goes to the user or various other locations. Object-oriented programming is a way to simplify your program by taking that basic pattern and repeating it on a smaller scale.  Just like a program is a large collection of data with code that knows what to do with it, each object is a small piece of data bound to code that knows what to do with it. By breaking down the problem domain into smaller pieces and making sure as much data as possible is bound directly to code that knows what to do with it, you make it a lot easier to reason about the process as a whole and also about the sub-issues that make up the process. By grouping data into object classes, you can centralize code related to that data, making relevant code easier both to find and to debug.  And by encapsulating the data behind access specifiers and only accessing it through methods, (or properties, if your language supports them,) you greatly reduce the potential for data corruption or the violation of invariants. And by using inheritance and polymorphism, you can reuse preexisting classes, customizing them to fit your specific needs, without having to either modify the originals or rewrite everything from the ground up.  (Which is a thing you should never do, if you can avoid it.)  Just be careful you understand your base object, or you could end up with killer kangaroos. To me, these are the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming: complexity management, code centralization and improved problem-domain modeling through the creation of object classes, inheritance and polymorphism, and increased safety without sacrificing power or control through the use of encapsulation and properties.  I hope this helps you understand why so many programmers find it useful. EDIT: In response to Joel's question in the comments,  Can you explain what an \"object-oriented program\" contains   (other than these fancy defintions you've outlined) that is fundamentally   different from an imperative program? How do you \"get the ball rolling?\"  A little disclaimer here.  My model of \"an object-oriented program\" is basically the Delphi model, which is very similar to the C#/.NET model since they were created by former Delphi team members.  What I'm saying here may not apply, or not apply as much, in other OO languages. An object-oriented program is one in which all the logic is structured around objects.  Of course this has to be bootstrapped somewhere.  Your typical Delphi program contains initialization code that creates a singleton object called Application.  At the start of the program, it calls Application.Initialize, then a call to Application.CreateForm for every form you want to load into memory from the beginning, and then Application.Run, which displays the main form on screen and starts up the input/event loop that forms the core of any interactive computer programs. Application and your forms poll for incoming events from the OS and translate them into method calls on your object.  One thing that's very common is the use of event handlers, or \"delegates\" in .NET-speak.  An object has a method that says, \"do X and Y, but also check to see if this particular event handler is assigned, and call it if it is.\"  An event handler is a method pointer--a very simple closure that contains a reference to the method and a reference to the object instance--that's used to extend the behavior of objects.  For example, if I have a button object on my form, I customize its behavior by attaching an OnClick event handler, which causes some other object to execute a method when the button is clicked. So in an object-oriented program, most of the work gets done by defining objects with certain responsibilities and linking them together, either through method pointers or by one object directly calling a method defined in another object's public interface.  (And now we're back to encapsulation.)  This is an idea that I had no concept of back before I took OOP classes in college. ",

I have another question if a project goes over budget it's bad. Recently, I missed an entire menu when calculating the cost of transferring a website over to a new platform so the project went over budget. My boss was not happy at all, and it's my opinion that some things like this can't be avoided. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0\u00a0What is the general practice for dealing with going over budget    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and do projects like web development often go over budget?

You could be doing work that they bill to clients in that 35 hours and you should. If they figure out a project will take 50 hours and I take 55 hours, that 5 hours could have been spent on another project that wasn't over budget so we just \"lost\" money. Another example is that if I only have 1 project, that is due in two weeks and I spend a day  doing internal work, some how we lost money because I wasn't working.

        "ChatGpt answer": "It sounds like you are dealing with a lot of challenges in your new role at the web design firm. Here are some suggestions for addressing your concerns:  1. When it comes to giving quotes without sufficient information, it may be helpful to create a standard pricing structure based on past projects. This can give you a starting point for estimating costs and hours required, even with limited information. You could also consider setting up a tiered pricing system based on the complexity of the project, which can help account for unknown variables.  2. Going over budget is a common issue in many industries, including web development. It's important to communicate with your team and clients throughout the project to address any potential scope changes that could impact the budget. In cases where a project does go over budget, it may be necessary to absorb some of the costs, negotiate with the client, or make changes to the project scope to bring it back within budget.  3. In terms of billable hour systems, it sounds like your current system may not be the most efficient or fair for developers. Consider discussing with your management team about implementing a more flexible system that takes into account the value of the work being done, rather than just the number of billable hours. This could help alleviate some of the pressure to meet a specific number of billable hours each week and allow for a more balanced workload.  Overall, it's important to communicate openly with your team and management about any challenges you are facing and work together to find solutions that work for everyone involved.

At least to me, it would appear that topcoder.com gives a more objective evaluation of pure ability to solve problems and write code. At the same time, despite obvious technical capabilities, this person may lack any hint of social skills -- he may be purely a \"lone coder\", with little or no ability to help/work with others, may lack mentoring ability to help transfer his technical skills to others, etc. On the other hand, stackoverflow.com would at least appear to give a much better indication of peers' opinion of the coder in question, and the degree to which his presence and useful and helpful to others on the \"team\". At the same time, the scoring system is such that somebody who just throws up a lot of mediocre (or even poor answers) will almost inevitably accumulate a positive total of \"reputation\" points -- a single up-vote (perhaps just out of courtesy) will counteract the effects of no fewer than 5 down-votes, and others are discouraged (to some degree) from down-voting because they have to sacrifice their own reputation points to do so. At the same time, somebody who makes little or no technical contribution seems unlikely to accumulate a reputation that lands them (even close to) the top of the heap, so to speak.

Are some native, natural languages better-suited for thinking about programming than others?  For instance, can the following be stated more concisely in a non-English language?  Select a pivot.  Move all the items less than the pivot to one side of the list, and all the items greater than the pivot to the other side. Does a Chinese-speaking programmer view programming in a radically different lens than an English-speaking programmer, or do the differences fade away when both are immersed in the subject? Are some programming languages and domains easier to think about in one language or another.  For instance, is it any easier to grok Ruby if you are Japanese because the creator of Ruby is Japanese?  Note that this question is not focused on \"how do programming languages affect the way people think about programming\", but rather \"how do natural languages affect the way people think about programming\". To get it out of the way, one language that clearly has a pragmatic advantage is English.  I think the advantage has little to do with programming languages choosing English keywords like if, for, while, and do, just as musicians who don't speak Italian aren't tripped up by words like forte.  It has more to do with communication of ideas with other programmers, as English is the lingua franca these days, at least in the programming world.  For instance, to ask a question in StackOverflow, you really need to know English and know it pretty well if you want good answers.  Although this sounds like an imperialist attitude, it really is true in practice.

        "ChatGpt answer": "It is a complex question with no definitive answer. Some programmers may feel more comfortable thinking and expressing themselves in their native language, while others may adapt easily to programming concepts regardless of the language they speak. The structure and nuances of a language may influence the way a programmer approaches problem-solving, but it is ultimately up to the individual's cognitive abilities and experience in the field.  Certain languages may have features that align more closely with specific programming paradigms, making them more intuitive for speakers of those languages. For example, functional programming languages like Haskell may resonate more with speakers of languages that have a strong emphasis on recursion and functional programming concepts.   However, at the end of the day, the ability to think abstractly, logically, and algorithmically is more important than the language in which these concepts are expressed. While some languages may have advantages in terms of conciseness or expressiveness, a skilled programmer should be able to adapt and learn to think in any programming language, regardless of their native language.

Is this a special case?  What makes it an exception? However, the first still isn't universal, because I have seen the latter style.  Besides consistency along the lines of \"there's always a space with the identifier, so we have one without\", are there any other reasons to prefer it? What about casts or array and function types?  How would you re-write these: (void*)var /*or*/ (void *)var  int[3] /*or*/ int [3] // more relevant in C++ than C: Example<int[3]>  void(int) /*or*/ void (int) // more relevant in C++ than C: std::function<void(int)>  The latter two would rarely, if ever, be used in C, but are seen with C++ templates. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "In general, the placement of the asterisk in pointer declarations is a matter of personal preference and coding style. In C and C++, both int* i and int *i declare a pointer variable i of type int. The choice between the two is often based on readability and consistency within a codebase.  When writing code with a missing identifier, the same principles can be applied. For example, void f(int*) and void f(int *) both declare a function f that takes a pointer to an int as an argument. Again, the choice between the two styles is primarily based on personal preference and the coding conventions of the project or team.  In the case of casts, arrays, and function types, similar considerations can be made. For instance, (void*)var and (void *)var both cast var to a void pointer type. Similarly, int[3] and int [3] both declare an array of three integers. The choice between the two styles can depend on the consistency in the codebase or personal preference.  When it comes to more complex types like function pointers or template types in C++, the placement of spaces and asterisks can also vary. For example, void(int) and void (int) both declare a function pointer that takes an int argument and returns void. Similarly, Example<int[3]> and Example<int [3]> both instantiate a template class Example with an array of three integers as the template argument.  Overall, the choice of where to place spaces and asterisks in C and C++ declarations is a matter of personal preference, readability, and consistency within a codebase. There is no strict rule governing this, so developers should choose the style that works best for them and their team.",

Are huge (100+ line) functions still considered evil even if they're well-structured internally via the use of nested functions? Edit:  For those of you not familiar with Python or D, nested functions in these languages also allow access to the outer function scope.  In D this access allows mutation of variables in the outer scope.  In Python it only allows reading.  In D you can explicitly disable access to the outer scope in a nested function by declaring it static. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "While nested functions can help to structure and organize complex logic within a larger function, it is generally still considered best practice to keep functions relatively small and focused on a single responsibility.   Huge functions, even if well-structured internally, can be harder to understand, debug, and maintain. Breaking down a large function into smaller, more modular functions can make the code easier to comprehend and modify in the future.  A good rule of thumb is to aim for functions that are around 10-20 lines long. If a function starts to grow beyond that size, it may be a sign that it is trying to do too much and could benefit from being broken down into smaller functions.   Using nested functions in languages like Python and D can certainly help with organizing the code, especially when dealing with shared variables and complex algorithms.

        "Question": " It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration  -- Edsger W. Dijkstra I have deep respect to Dijkstra but I don't agree with everything he said/wrote. I disagree specially with this quote on linked paper wrote 35 years ago about the Dartmouth BASIC implementation. Many of my coworkers or friends programmers started with BASIC, questions below have answers that indicate many programmers had their first experience on programming at BASIC. AFAIK many good programmers started at BASIC programming. I'm not talking about Visual Basic or other \"modern\" dialects of BASIC running on machines full of resources. I'm talking about old times BASIC running on \"toy\" computer, that the programmer had to worry about saving small numbers that need not be calculated as a string to save a measly byte because the computer had only a few hundreds of them, or have to use computed goto for lack of a more powerful feature, and many other things which require the programmer to think much before doing something and forcing the programmer to be creative. If you had experience with old time BASIC on a machine with limited resources (have in mind that a simple micro-controller today has much more resources than a computer in 1975, do you think that BASIC help your mind to find better solutions, to think like an engineer or BASIC drag you to dark side of programming and mutilated you mentally? Is good to learn a programming language running on a computer full of resources where the novice programmer can do all wrong and the program runs without big problems? Or is it better to learn where the programmer can't go wrong? What can you say about the BASIC have helped you to be a better/worse programmer? Would you teach old BASIC running on a 2KB (virtual) machine to a coming programmer? Sure, only exposure to BASIC is bad. Maybe you share my opinion that modern BASIC doesn't help too much because modern BASIC, as long other programming languages, gives facilities which allow the programmer doesn't think deeper. Additional information: Why BASIC? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are a few reasons why old BASIC programming on limited resources computers can actually be beneficial for a programmer's mindset:  1. Constraint breeds creativity: When working within strict limitations, programmers are forced to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions to problems. This can help develop problem-solving skills and creativity.  2. Understanding fundamentals: Working with a simplistic language like BASIC can help beginners understand the fundamental concepts of programming without getting overwhelmed by complex syntax or features.  3. Attention to detail: Limited resources require programmers to pay close attention to memory management, optimization, and efficiency. This can instill good habits in programmers and make them more mindful of their code.  4. Humility: Working with limited resources can teach programmers to be humble and appreciate the advancements in technology that have made programming easier today. This can help them approach their work with a sense of gratitude and respect for the craft.  In conclusion, while exposure to only BASIC may not be ideal for a programmer's development, learning on a 2KB virtual machine with limited resources can actually be a valuable learning experience. It can help build a strong foundation in programming fundamentals and foster skills such as problem-solving, creativity, attention to detail, and humility.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "The Basics popular at the time of the quote were very different from what we had even 20 years ago.  (Are you counting those among your \"modern\" dialects? ;) Forget loops, subroutines, local variables, and everything that Structured Programming (of which Dijkstra and Knuth were big proponents) emphasized.  You had GOTO, and you liked it. In this context, programmers who only knew global variables, invented their own subroutines (using more global variables for parameters and return values!), and wrote spaghetti GOTOs really were mutilated. If you're 30-something or younger today and Basic was your first language, it wasn't the same language Dijkstra was talking about.  Even if you're older and your first Basic had some of these features, as Murph comments below, it still may not have been the same language Dijkstra was talking about.  You've updated the question with context I never knew before:  Dijkstra's quote is from 1975. It wasn't until version 6 that you got separately compilable procedures \u2014 which, I believe, shows the beginning of the shift in focus away from GOTO. \"In 1976, Steve Garland added structured programming features to create Dartmouth SBASIC, a precompiler which produced version 6 output...\" [Wikipedia] The context of the quote is clearly before what we now know as control structures, and many users of the time could've been more familiar with the second-to-latest version \u2014 i.e. two versions before Garland's, which is v5 and before separately compilable procedures. GOSUB/RETURN still only handle \"simple subroutines\". \"Variable names were limited to A to Z, A0 to A9, B0 to B9, ..., Z0 to Z9, giving a maximum of 286 possible distinct variables.\" ...and they're all global.

And, also, Roy wrote in comments:  My guideline is usually that you test one logical CONCEPT per test. you can have multiple asserts on the same object. they will usually be the same concept being tested.

However, there are definitely cases where multiple assertions are necessary, such as in a guard assertion scenario.

In this scenario, you may want to have multiple assertions to ensure that the method is functioning correctly. You may want to assert that the total price is calculated correctly based on the items in the cart, and also that the method handles invalid input (such as non-numeric values) by throwing an exception.   In this case, having multiple assertions allows you to test different aspects of the method's functionality within the same test case. It helps to ensure that the method is robust and handles various scenarios properly.

We talk   to Cyra Richardson and Giles Bowkett.  It got me thinking, what traits did the best managers you've worked for have in common? EDIT: Just to clarify, as there have been a few close votes, I'm interested in whether there are traits common to managers of developers that are not necessarily those traits that a manager of some other profession requires.  As for whether this is programming related or not, well I don't want to ask this question on a site that isn't about programming because, frankly, I'm not as interested in what people who make cans of soup for a living want from their managers as I am interested in what developers want from their managers.

        "Question": "Question first: What are some feasible alternatives to time tracking for employees in a web/software development company, and why are they better options Explanation: I work at a company where we work like this. Everybody is paid salary. We have 3 types of work, Contract, Adhoc and Internal (Non billable). Adhoc is just small changes that take a few hours and we just bill the client at the end of the month. Contracts are signed and we have this big long process, the usual. We figure out how much to charge by getting an estimation of the time involved (From the design and the developers), multiplying it by our hourly rate and that's it. So say we estimate 50 hours for a website. We have time tracking software and have to record the time in 15 we spend on it (7:00 to 7:15 for example), the project name, and give it some comments. Now if we go over the 50 hours, we are both losing money and are inefficient.  Now that I've explained how the system works, my question is how else can it be done if a better method exists (Which I'm sure one must). Nobody here likes the current system, we just can't find an alternative. I'd be more than willing to work after hours longer hours on a project to get it done in time, but I'm much inclined to do so with the current system. I'd love to be able to sum up (Or link) to this post for my manager to show them why we should use abc system instead of this system. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are several feasible alternatives to time tracking for employees in a web/software development company, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. Here are a few options:  1. Project-based pricing: Instead of tracking time spent on a project, the company could charge clients a flat rate for the entire project based on an estimate of the time and resources required. This can help eliminate the need for detailed time tracking and incentivize employees to work efficiently and effectively to complete the project within budget.  2. Agile project management: Agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, focus on delivering small, incremental improvements to a project on a regular basis. This approach can help increase team collaboration, adaptability to change, and overall project efficiency without the need for strict time tracking.  3. Outcome-based measurement: Instead of tracking time spent on tasks, the company could focus on measuring the outcomes and results of each project or task. This could involve setting specific goals and objectives for each project and evaluating the success of the project based on those outcomes rather than the time spent on it.  4. Trust-based work environment: Creating a trust-based work environment where employees are given autonomy and flexibility to manage their own time and tasks can also be a viable alternative to time tracking. This approach relies on open communication, accountability, and mutual respect between employees and management.  Overall, the best alternative will depend on the specific needs and goals of the company. It may be helpful to discuss these options with your manager and colleagues to determine the most suitable alternative for your team.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Take a look at evidence based scheduling.  Can really help you see how accurate your estimates are likely to be.  Over the last year or so at Fog Creek we\u2019ve been developing a system that\u2019s so easy even our grouchiest developers are willing to go along with it. And as far as we can tell, it produces extremely reliable schedules. It\u2019s called Evidence-Based Scheduling, or EBS. You gather evidence, mostly from historical timesheet data, that you feed back into your schedules. What you get is not just one ship date: you get a confidence distribution curve, showing the probability that you will ship on any given date. It looks like this:  The steeper the curve, the more confident you are that the ship date is real. Here\u2019s how you do it...  ",

        "Question": "I'm a self-taught programmer and have just started a computer science degree to supplement my knowledge and fill in the gaps. However, I'm already debating the direction of my education. I want a 4 year bachelor's degree for sure, but after that, I'm not sure: Is it worth it to get an M.Sc? What about a Ph.D.? What opportunities do these degrees open up? Currently my goal is to be a software developer, but there are a number of fascinating fields in the software industry and I'm certainly interested in investigating many of them. It is in this respect that I think a higher degree may be worth it -- even if it wouldn't necessarily help a career of software development. So will it be worth it? Will grad school open doors? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "The decision to pursue a higher degree such as a Master's or Ph.D. in computer science can depend on a variety of factors including your career goals, interests, and financial considerations.  Here are some potential benefits of pursuing a higher degree in computer science:  1. Specialization: A Master's or Ph.D. program allows you to specialize in a specific area of computer science that interests you. This can open up opportunities for more advanced and specialized roles in the industry.  2. Research Opportunities: Higher degrees often involve research projects that can lead to new knowledge and innovations in the field. If you are interested in research and development, a graduate degree may be beneficial.  3. Networking: Graduate programs offer opportunities to work closely with professors and other students who share your interests. This can help you build a strong professional network that can be valuable throughout your career.  4. Career Advancement: In some cases, a higher degree can lead to higher-paying job opportunities and faster career advancement. Some companies may also prefer to hire candidates with advanced degrees for certain roles.  However, it's important to consider the potential drawbacks of pursuing a higher degree as well:  1. Time and Cost: Graduate programs can be time-consuming and expensive. It's important to consider whether the investment of time and money is worth the potential benefits in terms of career opportunities.  2. Industry Experience: In some cases, employers may prioritize practical experience and skills over academic qualifications. If your goal is to become a software developer, gaining hands-on experience in the industry may be more important than pursuing a higher degree.  3. Personal Fulfillment: Ultimately, the decision to pursue a higher degree should align with your personal interests and goals. If you are passionate about a specific area of computer science and see value in furthering your education, then a graduate degree may be worth pursuing.  In conclusion, whether or not grad school is worth it for you will depend on your individual circumstances and career goals. It's important to carefully weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks before making a decision. Consider speaking with professionals in the field, professors, and career counselors to gather more information and insights to help inform your decision.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Getting a PhD does two things to you and it uses up 4 or more years. You will need to decide whether those two things are worth the time. First, it gives you some initials after your name. For the rest of time, people who see those initials will think \"wow, you must be really smart!\" (and often, they will say it out loud.) On a resume it will generally help you, though in some circumstances it might hurt you, with people thinking you're overqualified or an egghead. Second, and more importantly in my opinion, is the changes in your brain and your attitude that happen over the course of the degree. You will end up knowing more about some small part of the world than any other person. You will stand in front of 3 or 4 people who are experts, sometimes world-renowned experts, and teach them about your work. When you walk in, those experts will be supervisor, examiner, \"bosses\" of a sort and when you walk out they will be your peers. You  will learn a lot about one corner of computer science and a lot more about yourself and your capabilities. You will be confident being \"the expert\" when required. And that changes everything. Unless you know now you want to be a prof, or to join a particular research lab, it seems unusual to me that you could decide about the PhD before doing the undergrad work. Go do the undergrad, and make friends with some grad students. They will tell you all you want to know about the life of a grad student, the life of a baby prof, the job prospects when you're out, and more. I don't regret the time I spent on my PhD. It has opened many doors for me. It has made me more memorable (\"right, you're the woman with the PhD, aren't you?\") and been an asset to some of my teams independent of my abilities or knowledge (\"we have a PhD on our team!\"). But the industry I joined then is not the industry you're joining now. Talk to people who are in the thick of it now and then make a decision as you finish the undergrad work. ",
