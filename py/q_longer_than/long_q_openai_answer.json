        "Question": "I have read a few articles on Internet about programming language choice in the enterprise. Recently many dynamic typed languages have been popular, i.e. Ruby, Python, PHP and Erlang. But many enterprises still stay with static typed languages like C, C++, C# and Java. And yes, one of the benefits of static typed languages is that programming errors are caught earlier, at compile time, rather than at run time. But there are also advantages with dynamic typed languages. (more on Wikipedia) The main reason why enterprises don't start to use languages like Erlang, Ruby and Python, seem to be the fact that they are dynamic typed. That also seem to be the main reason why people on StackOverflow decide against Erlang. See Why did you decide \"against\" Erlang. However, there seem to be a strong criticism against dynamic typing in the enterprises, but I don't really get it why it is that strong. Really, why is there so much criticism against dynamic typing in the enterprises? Does it really affect the cost of projects that much, or what? But maybe I'm wrong. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "The criticism against dynamic typing in enterprises often stems from concerns about code maintenance, scalability, and reliability. In dynamic typed languages, variables do not have predefined types and can change during runtime, leading to potential errors that may not be caught until the code is actually executed. This can make it more difficult to maintain and debug code, especially in larger and more complex projects.  Additionally, dynamic typing can make it harder to scale projects as they grow, as it may be harder to refactor code and ensure consistent behavior across different parts of the application. This can lead to increased costs and longer development times, as developers may need to spend more time fixing bugs and ensuring the stability of the codebase.  On the other hand, static typed languages like Java and C# provide a level of safety and predictability that can make it easier to develop and maintain enterprise-level applications. By catching errors at compile time, developers can ensure that their code is more robust and reliable, reducing the likelihood of bugs and errors in production.  Ultimately, the choice between dynamic and static typed languages depends on the specific requirements of the project and the preferences of the development team. While dynamic typed languages may offer certain advantages in terms of flexibility and expressiveness, enterprises may prioritize stability and reliability, leading them to choose static typed languages instead.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": " The main reason why enterprises don't start to use languages like Erlang, Ruby and Python, seem to be the fact that they are dynamic typed.  I think this is only their primary excuse. The real reason is that businesses don\u2019t really take them all that seriously and feel that they are perhaps a bit too amateur. Java and .NET are \u201cbig business names\u201d, have good commercial marketing, commercial customer support, and are thus widely taken very seriously indeed. It is unfortunate that there is practically no statically-typed language that is anywhere near as popular as the big business names. Why are open-source/free-software programming environments almost always dynamically typed? This might indicate that a statically-typed language is actually not that easy to make, and that dynamic typing is a \u201clazy man\u2019s hack\u201d. If that is the case, the businesses who decide against dynamically-typed languages might actually have a point. ",

        "Question": "During my four years at university we have been using much functional programming in several functional programming languages. But I have also used much object oriented programming to, and in fact I use object oriented languages more when doing my own small project to prepare for my first job. But I often wish that I was coding in a functional programming language when doing these projects. However, when looking for a job, it is very rare to see a job where knowledge of a functional programming language is required. Why isn't functional programming languages used more in the industry? There is quite much news about functional programming languages these days, so I wonder if functional programming is catching on in the industry now? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Functional programming has been gaining popularity in recent years due to its focus on immutability, higher-order functions, and declarative programming style. Many companies are starting to see the benefits of using functional programming languages, such as improved code quality, easier debugging, and better scalability.  However, there are still some challenges to widespread adoption of functional programming languages in industry. One of the main reasons is that many developers are more familiar with object-oriented programming languages, such as Java or C++, and may not have the necessary skills to work with functional programming languages like Haskell or Scala.  Additionally, functional programming languages can have a steeper learning curve compared to object-oriented languages, which may make it more difficult for companies to find developers with the necessary expertise. As a result, many companies may continue to stick with what they know and are comfortable with, rather than taking the risk of adopting a new paradigm.  That being said, there are certainly industries and companies that are embracing functional programming, especially in areas like finance, data science, and machine learning where the benefits of functional programming are particularly apparent. As more developers become proficient in functional programming languages and more companies see the advantages of using them, we may start to see a wider adoption of functional programming in the industry.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I would say that one of the reasons that functional programming is not more prevalent is the lack of knowledge base.  My experience is that corporations are very risk averse in terms of implementing technologies that are not main stream and would rather invest in tried and true frameworks (java, c++, c#).  It's only when there is a business need (like in Ericsson) that new paradigms are considered.  But even in Ericsson's case I heard that management demanded that c++ be used and Joe Armstrong was compelled to code erlang calls in c++!! This should show how reluctant corporations are to implement new technologies! ",
