        "Question": "I have read a few articles on Internet about programming language choice in the enterprise. Recently many dynamic typed languages have been popular, i.e. Ruby, Python, PHP and Erlang. But many enterprises still stay with static typed languages like C, C++, C# and Java. And yes, one of the benefits of static typed languages is that programming errors are caught earlier, at compile time, rather than at run time. But there are also advantages with dynamic typed languages. (more on Wikipedia) The main reason why enterprises don't start to use languages like Erlang, Ruby and Python, seem to be the fact that they are dynamic typed. That also seem to be the main reason why people on StackOverflow decide against Erlang. See Why did you decide \"against\" Erlang. However, there seem to be a strong criticism against dynamic typing in the enterprises, but I don't really get it why it is that strong. Really, why is there so much criticism against dynamic typing in the enterprises? Does it really affect the cost of projects that much, or what? But maybe I'm wrong. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are a few reasons why dynamic typing is often criticized in the enterprise setting.   One of the main concerns is that dynamic typing can lead to potentially more errors and bugs in the code. Since the type of a variable is not explicitly declared, it can be easier for developers to make mistakes and introduce runtime errors. This can lead to more time spent debugging and fixing issues, which can ultimately impact the cost and timeline of a project.  Additionally, dynamic typing can make code more difficult to read and maintain, especially in larger projects with multiple developers working on the same codebase. Without explicit type annotations, it can be harder for developers to understand the code and make changes without inadvertently introducing errors.  Another issue with dynamic typing is that it can make refactoring and code reusability more challenging. Since the types of variables can change at runtime, it can be harder to refactor code or extract reusable components without breaking existing functionality.  Overall, while dynamic typing does offer some benefits in terms of flexibility and ease of development, it can also introduce risks and challenges that may not be worth it for larger, more complex enterprise projects. This is why many enterprises still prefer to stick with static typing languages for their critical systems.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Yes, I believe that they do. There are a few reasons that need to be considered in the selection of a language for a new project:  Run-time speed. Compared to C/C++/Fortran, Perl and Python are so slow it's funny. Initialization speed. Compared to the above fast languages, Java falls over and cries as the JVM keeps loading and loading and...while(1).... Prototype-ability. Exhaustively going through and doing the declaration/definition work required for C++ or Java increases the LOC, which is the only known metric that reliably correlates with bugcounts. It also takes a lot of time. It also requires a bit more thinking about types and connections. Internal fiddlability. Dynamically messing around with your internals is great until you begin to debug your self-modifying code. (Python, Lisp, Perl) Correctness verification. A compiler can provide a quick once-over pass of semi-correctness of your code in C++, and this can be really nice.  Static analysis details. C and Java have pretty good static analysis. Perl is not completely statically analyzable at a theoretical level (Possibly Python too). I'm reasonably sure Lisp isn't either.  Weird platforms only take C, in general.  Support chain. If you can have a contract that you will get your bugs looked at and worked on, that's huge.   If you can presume that the organization you are working with has a principle of \"Going forward\"(There's an accounting term for this), and won't just randomly decide to not work on the software, then you have a much better case for using the software. Since there's no Major Business selling (carrying implication of taking responsibility of maintaining it) Python/Perl/$dynamic_language, it considerably reduces risk.  In my experience, open source maintainers often have an issue with fully taking responsibility for bugfixes and releasing updates. \"It's free, YOU work on it!\" is not an answer that is acceptable to most businesses (not their core compentencies, among other things).  Of course, I'm not talking about the webapp/startup world, which tends to play by high risk/high reward rules and be very open to staying on the frothing edge of tech. ",

        "Question": "During my four years at university we have been using much functional programming in several functional programming languages. But I have also used much object oriented programming to, and in fact I use object oriented languages more when doing my own small project to prepare for my first job. But I often wish that I was coding in a functional programming language when doing these projects. However, when looking for a job, it is very rare to see a job where knowledge of a functional programming language is required. Why isn't functional programming languages used more in the industry? There is quite much news about functional programming languages these days, so I wonder if functional programming is catching on in the industry now? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are a few reasons why functional programming languages are not as commonly used in industry compared to object-oriented programming languages.   Firstly, functional programming languages have a steeper learning curve compared to object-oriented languages. Many developers are already familiar with object-oriented programming and may find it easier to stick with what they know rather than learning a new paradigm.   Secondly, functional programming languages may not always be the best choice for certain types of projects. Object-oriented programming is often better suited for projects that require a lot of state management and mutable data, whereas functional programming excels in projects that require handling a lot of complex data transformations and mathematical operations.   Lastly, there may also be limitations in terms of the availability of libraries, frameworks, and tooling for functional programming languages compared to object-oriented languages. This can make it more challenging for companies to adopt functional programming in their projects.  That being said, there is definitely a growing interest in functional programming languages in the industry. Many companies are starting to see the benefits of using functional programming languages in certain scenarios, such as improved code quality, better parallelism, and increased productivity. As a result, there has been a rise in job postings that require knowledge of functional programming languages. So, while functional programming may not be as prevalent as object-oriented programming, it is certainly gaining traction in the industry.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I was a professor and, just like programmers, professors are always looking for the Next Big Thing. When they think they've found one, they make it a bandwagon, and everyone piles on. Since they are preaching to students who think professors must be really smart, else why would they be professors, they get no resistance. Functional programming is such a bandwagon. Sure it's got lots of nice interesting questions to investigate, and lots of sort-of-interesting conference articles to write. It's not a particularly new idea, and you can do it in just about any modern language, and ideas don't have to be new to be interesting. It's also a good skill to have. Given that, functional programming is just one arrow to have in your quiver, not the only one, just as OOP is not the only one. My beef with computer science academia is lack of practical interplay with industry to determine what actually makes real-world sense, i.e. quality control. If that quality control were there, there might be a different emphasis, on classifying problems and the ranges of solutions to them, with tradeoffs, rather than just the latest bandwagons. ",
