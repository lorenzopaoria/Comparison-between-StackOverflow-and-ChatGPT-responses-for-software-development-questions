        "Question": "I have read a few articles on Internet about programming language choice in the enterprise. Recently many dynamic typed languages have been popular, i.e. Ruby, Python, PHP and Erlang. But many enterprises still stay with static typed languages like C, C++, C# and Java. And yes, one of the benefits of static typed languages is that programming errors are caught earlier, at compile time, rather than at run time. But there are also advantages with dynamic typed languages. (more on Wikipedia) The main reason why enterprises don't start to use languages like Erlang, Ruby and Python, seem to be the fact that they are dynamic typed. That also seem to be the main reason why people on StackOverflow decide against Erlang. See Why did you decide \"against\" Erlang. However, there seem to be a strong criticism against dynamic typing in the enterprises, but I don't really get it why it is that strong. Really, why is there so much criticism against dynamic typing in the enterprises? Does it really affect the cost of projects that much, or what? But maybe I'm wrong. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are a few reasons why dynamic typing may be criticized in the enterprise setting. One of the main reasons is that it can lead to more errors and bugs in the code. Without the compiler checking for type errors at compile time, it is easier for bugs to go unnoticed until runtime, which can be costly and time-consuming to fix.   Additionally, dynamic typing can make code harder to maintain and understand, especially in larger and more complex projects. Without explicit type declarations, it can be more difficult for developers to understand how data is being passed around and manipulated in the codebase. This can lead to confusion and errors down the line.  Another reason for the criticism against dynamic typing in the enterprise is the potential performance impact. Dynamic languages often have slower execution times compared to static languages, as type checking needs to be done at runtime. This can be problematic for enterprise applications that require high performance and scalability.  Overall, while dynamic typing can offer flexibility and productivity benefits in certain contexts, it may not always be the best choice for enterprise applications where reliability, performance, and maintainability are critical factors. Each language has its own strengths and weaknesses, and it is important for enterprises to carefully consider their specific needs and requirements when choosing a programming language for their projects.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Yes, I believe that they do. There are a few reasons that need to be considered in the selection of a language for a new project:  Run-time speed. Compared to C/C++/Fortran, Perl and Python are so slow it's funny. Initialization speed. Compared to the above fast languages, Java falls over and cries as the JVM keeps loading and loading and...while(1).... Prototype-ability. Exhaustively going through and doing the declaration/definition work required for C++ or Java increases the LOC, which is the only known metric that reliably correlates with bugcounts. It also takes a lot of time. It also requires a bit more thinking about types and connections. Internal fiddlability. Dynamically messing around with your internals is great until you begin to debug your self-modifying code. (Python, Lisp, Perl) Correctness verification. A compiler can provide a quick once-over pass of semi-correctness of your code in C++, and this can be really nice.  Static analysis details. C and Java have pretty good static analysis. Perl is not completely statically analyzable at a theoretical level (Possibly Python too). I'm reasonably sure Lisp isn't either.  Weird platforms only take C, in general.  Support chain. If you can have a contract that you will get your bugs looked at and worked on, that's huge.   If you can presume that the organization you are working with has a principle of \"Going forward\"(There's an accounting term for this), and won't just randomly decide to not work on the software, then you have a much better case for using the software. Since there's no Major Business selling (carrying implication of taking responsibility of maintaining it) Python/Perl/$dynamic_language, it considerably reduces risk.  In my experience, open source maintainers often have an issue with fully taking responsibility for bugfixes and releasing updates. \"It's free, YOU work on it!\" is not an answer that is acceptable to most businesses (not their core compentencies, among other things).  Of course, I'm not talking about the webapp/startup world, which tends to play by high risk/high reward rules and be very open to staying on the frothing edge of tech. ",

        "Question": "During my four years at university we have been using much functional programming in several functional programming languages. But I have also used much object oriented programming to, and in fact I use object oriented languages more when doing my own small project to prepare for my first job. But I often wish that I was coding in a functional programming language when doing these projects. However, when looking for a job, it is very rare to see a job where knowledge of a functional programming language is required. Why isn't functional programming languages used more in the industry? There is quite much news about functional programming languages these days, so I wonder if functional programming is catching on in the industry now? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Functional programming languages have been gaining popularity in recent years due to their ability to create more robust, scalable, and easily maintained code. However, the adoption of functional programming in the industry has been slower compared to object-oriented programming languages.   One reason for this slow adoption is the fact that many companies have existing codebases written in object-oriented languages, and transitioning to functional programming can be a daunting task. Additionally, there may be a lack of experienced developers with expertise in functional programming languages, making it harder for companies to justify the switch.  That being said, there are industries and companies that are starting to embrace functional programming due to its advantages. For example, in the finance and banking sector, functional programming languages like Haskell and Scala are gaining traction due to their ability to handle complex mathematical computations and ensure accuracy in financial transactions.  Overall, the adoption of functional programming in the industry is gradually increasing, but it may take some time before it becomes as widespread as object-oriented programming. As a developer with knowledge in both paradigms, you have a valuable skillset that can be useful in various job opportunities. It's always good to stay updated on industry trends and continue honing your skills in both functional and object-oriented programming.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I was a professor and, just like programmers, professors are always looking for the Next Big Thing. When they think they've found one, they make it a bandwagon, and everyone piles on. Since they are preaching to students who think professors must be really smart, else why would they be professors, they get no resistance. Functional programming is such a bandwagon. Sure it's got lots of nice interesting questions to investigate, and lots of sort-of-interesting conference articles to write. It's not a particularly new idea, and you can do it in just about any modern language, and ideas don't have to be new to be interesting. It's also a good skill to have. Given that, functional programming is just one arrow to have in your quiver, not the only one, just as OOP is not the only one. My beef with computer science academia is lack of practical interplay with industry to determine what actually makes real-world sense, i.e. quality control. If that quality control were there, there might be a different emphasis, on classifying problems and the ranges of solutions to them, with tradeoffs, rather than just the latest bandwagons. ",

        "Question": "For the longest time in places like Java's IRC channel, SO, and other places I've been told something along the lines of \"Worry about how the code looks and its readability/understandability now, and performance later if absolutely necessary\". So for the longest time, I haven't really been OCD about performance for my small desktop or web apps, just removing the obviously inefficient. Most responses are \"What about scalability?\". Thats a legitimate point, but if my app was only built to parse, say, files 10,000 lines long, should I make my code a mess for the small percentage of people that are going to shove in a 1,000,000 line file? My main question is when should I trade the easy but somewhat inefficient ways of doing tasks for big giant complicated beasts that do things extremely quickly but destroy any possible ways of upgrading and make the code excessively difficult and prone to rewriting anyway by the next developer?  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Ultimately, the decision of when to prioritize performance over code readability and simplicity will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your project. Here are a few factors to consider when making this decision:  1. Project requirements: If your app needs to handle large amounts of data or scale to accommodate a large number of users, performance may be a more critical factor to consider. In this case, it may be worth investing the time and effort to optimize your code for efficiency.  2. User experience: If slow performance impacts the usability of your app or frustrates users, it may be worth prioritizing performance optimizations to improve overall user experience.  3. Long-term maintenance: Consider the long-term implications of choosing a performance optimization approach that makes the code more complex and harder to maintain. Will future updates and modifications be more difficult with this approach? Will it require additional time and resources to maintain and debug in the future?  4. Benchmarking and testing: Before making any decisions on performance optimizations, it's important to benchmark and test different approaches to ensure that the optimizations actually result in a significant improvement in performance. Consider the trade-offs between performance gains and code complexity.  In general, it's a good idea to prioritize code readability and maintainability in the initial stages of development, as this will make it easier for you and other developers to work with the code in the future. If performance becomes a critical concern as the project progresses, you can then prioritize optimizations as needed. Remember that it's always a balance between performance, readability, and maintainability, and the best approach will depend on the specific needs of your project.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Worry about performance when it becomes a problem. If you write a small app to process 10,000 line files and you get a 1,000,000 line file every 100th file, it probably doesn't matter that it takes longer to process that one file. However, if you are regularly getting files that are 5-10 times larger than initially and your application is taking too long to do its job, then you start profiling and optimizing. Now, I said \"too long to do its job\". That is up to the user or sponsoring organization to decide. If I'm doing a task and it takes me 5 minutes to do something when it took me 3 without the software or with a different tool, I'd probably file a bug report or maintenance request to have that improved. If you are the user, how long you want your software to take to do its job is up to you - only you can decide if you want it done faster or if you are willing to wait longer to have more readable code.

        "Question": "I've been told that to be taken seriously as a job applicant, I should drop years of relevant experience off my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, remove the year I got my degree, or both. Or not even bother applying, because no one wants to hire programmers older than them.1 Or that I should found a company, not because I want to, or because I have a product I care about, but because that way I can get a job if/when my company is acquired. Or that I should focus more on management jobs (which I've successfully done in the past) because\u2026 well, they couldn't really explain this one, except the implication was that over a certain age you're a loser if you're still writing code.

How old (when hired) was the oldest person you hired?  How old is \"too old\" to employed as a programmer? 1 I'm assuming all applicants have equivalent applicable experience. This isn't about someone with three decades of COBOL applying for a Java guru job. 2 Yes, I know that (at least in the US) you aren't supposed to ask how old an applicant is. In my experience, though, you can get a general idea from a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Age discrimination in the tech industry is unfortunately a common issue, and it's not just limited to Northern California. Many older programmers face challenges in finding employment due to stereotypes about their ability to keep up with new technologies or work in a fast-paced environment.  As a hiring manager, it's important to focus on skills and experience rather than age. It's illegal to discriminate based on age, and companies can miss out on valuable talent by overlooking older applicants.   It's not about being \"too old\" to be employed as a programmer; it's about having the skills and experience necessary to excel in the role. Age should not be a determining factor in hiring decisions.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I'm 52, and Technology Director of a company I co-founded 15 years ago, and this is a question close to my heart. I spend about 40% of my time coding, mainly developing existing and new products and I truly hope to be doing the same thing in 10 years time.  I'm intrigued by the notion that older programmers are uniquely hampered by irrelevant skillsets. I find that this is the problem with younger developers - if I want an Flash Programmer, or a Flex Programmer, that's easy. If I want one with proven enterprise database or network skills, or with a track record of commercial product development, that's much more difficult to find. Older programmers can talk more articulately about design choices and software lifecycle issues simply because they've had a lifetime of experience of successes - and failures. The problem for older programmers is not that they are losing their intellectual capacity, but that they've been seduced by the notion that they should become 'managers'. In my opinion a good programmer with decades of experience can earn more developing software than by climbing some ill-defined management ladder,  provided they find (or start) an organisation which rewards innovation and ability.  In a world where millions of developers with the same skillsets are available via the internet, the idea that youth alone has value is simply dumb. ",

        "ChatGpt answer": "In code golf, analogously to equipment, code golfers have the choice of programming languages and libraries to use. Just like selecting the right club in golf, choosing the most efficient language or library can make a significant impact on the number of characters needed to solve a problem.  Similarly, techniques in code golf could be compared to coding tricks and shortcuts. Just like a golfer uses specific movements and techniques to improve their game, code golfers use clever coding techniques and algorithms to reduce the number of characters needed to solve a problem.   Lastly, strategies in code golf can be likened to planning and optimizing the overall approach to solving a problem. Just as a golfer strategically plans their shots and navigates the course, code golfers strategically plan their code and optimize their solutions to achieve the shortest possible code length.

        "Question": "Managed OSes like Microsoft Singularity and JNode are quite an interesting concept. Essentially, the OS is bootstrapped with code written in a low-level language (C/C++/Assembly), which essentially implements a virtual machine. The rest of the OS (and all userland apps) run on the virtual machine. There are some great things about this. For example, you suddenly make arbitrary pointers obsolete. And if well written, you get rid of a ton of legacy crud that most modern OSes currently have.  However, as a disadvantage, you're that much farther away from the hardware, and as a developer, you lose the ability to drop down to a lower level of abstraction and get your hands dirty.  What are your opinions on this? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "I think managed OSes have their pros and cons. On one hand, they can provide a higher level of security and stability, as well as a more streamlined and efficient system without all the legacy baggage. On the other hand, developers may feel limited by the lack of direct access to hardware and the inability to work at a lower level.  It really depends on the goals and priorities of the project and the developers involved. For some, the trade-offs may be worth it for the increased security and ease of development. For others, the limitations may be too restrictive and they may prefer a more traditional approach.  Overall, I think managed OSes have the potential to be a valuable alternative for certain use cases and projects, but it's important to carefully consider the trade-offs and implications before choosing to develop one.",

If you're writing applications such as web browsers, word processors etc. where lightning fast performance is not necessarily an issue then this approach has it's merits.

Not only are you limiting the damage that can be done by malware, but you are also running in a more consistent environment. It's like the difference between console games and PC games. The former know exactly what hardware they need to work with so can make use of that knowledge whereas the latter have to be able to cope with a wider variety of graphics cards, sound cards, hard disk speeds etc. However, there will be applications (such as games!) that require the low level access and will still need to be run \"natively\".

Nobody has done an in depth analysis of all the implications. The new feature will probably break some assumptions you made in your code and you start thinking immediately of all the things you might have to refactor.  You have other things to do from past assignments and you will have to come up with an estimate that takes that other work into account. The 'done' definition is probably unclear: When will it be done? 'Done' as in just finished coding it, or 'done' as in \"the users are using it\"? No matter how conscious you are of all these things, sometimes your \"programmer's pride\" makes you give/accept shorter times than you originally suppose it might take. Specially when you feel the pressure of deadlines and management expectations.  Many of these are organizational or cultural issues that are not simple and easy to solve, but in the end the reality is that you are being asked for an estimate and they expect you to give a reasonable answer. It's part of your job. You cannot simply say: I don't know.  As a result, I always end up giving estimates that I later realize I cannot fulfill.

        "ChatGpt answer": "One technique I have found useful in providing accurate estimates is breaking down the task into smaller, more manageable chunks. By dividing the project into smaller tasks, I can better estimate the time required for each one and account for any unexpected challenges that may arise.  Another technique is to pad my estimates with extra time for unforeseen circumstances or delays. This helps to account for any additional work that may be required and allows for a more realistic timeline for completion.  I also make sure to communicate with my team and stakeholders throughout the project, providing updates on progress and any potential delays. This helps to manage expectations and prevents any surprises when it comes to delivery time.  Overall, the key for me is to be transparent, realistic, and communicative when it comes to providing estimates for project timelines. It is better to under-promise and over-deliver than to make unrealistic promises that cannot be fulfilled.",

Estimates given at the coffee machine will (like the coffee) come back to haunt you.  In the section, the authors recommend the following process:  Determine the accuracy that you need. Based on the duration, you can quote the estimate in different precision. Saying \"5 to 6 months\" is different than saying \"150 days\". If you slip a little into the 7th month, you're still pretty accurate. But if you slip into the 180th or 210th day, not so much. Make sure you understand what is being asked. Determine the scope of the problem. Model the system. A model might be a mental model, diagrams, or existing data records. Decompose this model and build estimates from the components. Assign values and error ranges (+/-) to each value. Calculate the estimate based on your model. Track your estimates. Record information about the problem you are estimating, your estimate, and the actual values. Other things to include in your estimate are developing and documenting requirements or changes to requirements specifications, creating or updating design documents and specifications, testing (unit, integration, and acceptance), creating or updating user's manuals or READMEs with the changes. If 2 or more people working together, there's overhead of communication (phone calls, emails, meetings) and merging source code. If it's a long task, account for things like other work, time off (holidays, vacation, sick time), meetings, and other overhead tasks when picking a delivery date.  ",

Other examples may include list comprehensions in Python, template in C++ or LINQ in .NET or lazy evaluation in Haskell. What other semi-unique language features have you come across which were completely new and enlightening to you?  Are there other features of older programming languages which were unique and have fallen out of fashion? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One language feature that I found very interesting when learning Ruby was blocks (closures). Blocks are pieces of code that can be passed around as arguments to methods, enabling a more functional programming style. I found this feature very powerful and wished other languages had a similar concept.  Another feature that I found fascinating when learning Rust was ownership and borrowing. The way Rust handles memory management through ownership rules and borrowing at compile time was very new to me and I found it to be a very elegant solution to prevent common bugs like memory leaks and data races.  In terms of older programming languages, one unique feature that comes to mind is continuations in languages like Scheme and Smalltalk. Continuations allow you to capture the current state of a computation and then resume it later, which can be very useful for implementing things like coroutines and cooperative multitasking. However, continuations have fallen out of fashion in mainstream languages due to their complexity and potential for abuse.

There\u2019s no energy or impetus to change. The same is true of groups that stagnate. They cultivate mediocrity and complacency; they abhor risk. A river is always running and changing with lots of great energy. You want a river. A river depends on the flow of water, and your team depends on the flow of people and information. You can think of the people divided into three groups: new blood, new leaders, and elders ready for a new challenge.

Sometimes you\u2019ll have more new leaders than elders, sometimes the reverse, but ideally you should maintain a balance.  For flow, you want a steady stream of new blood becoming your new leaders, and new leaders becoming elders.  The key to flow is new blood coming in and elders moving out. For this to work, you WANT your elders to transfer before they clog the stream and disrupt the flow of opportunitiesfor others.   Not all technologies flow at the same rate. Central engines, like the Windows kernel, flow slowly, while web-based services, like MSN Search, flow quickly. You need to adjust for your situation, but even the most conservative technologies do change and flow. How do you successfully encourage and maintain a healthy flow?

        "Question": "I originally tried asking this on StackOverflow, but it was too subjective :-(. I am interested in methods of defining the power of programming languages. Turing completeness is one, but it is almost universally satisfied. What would be nice is to define a measure of power that discriminates among programming languages that are actually in used. For example, can anyone propose a non-subjective method that would discriminate between assembly and Java? Turing completeness means that a language is maximally powerful in what it can output (which pretty much means it can do anything non-time based in the real world). So if we want to define a stronger measure of power, we need to take another approach. Shortness was suggested in the original question, but this is not easy to define at all. Does anyone have any other suggestions? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One possible approach to defining the power of programming languages could be by measuring the level of abstraction they offer. Higher level languages, such as Java, provide more abstraction and therefore require less code to accomplish certain tasks compared to lower level languages like Assembly. This could be measured by the number of lines of code required to achieve the same functionality in different languages.  Another way to measure the power of a programming language could be by looking at the availability and functionality of libraries and frameworks. Languages with extensive libraries and frameworks can leverage existing code and resources to accomplish tasks more easily and efficiently. This could be measured by the range of available libraries and the ease of integration with external resources.  Additionally, the performance and efficiency of a programming language could be used as a measure of its power. Languages that are able to execute code quickly and use resources efficiently could be considered more powerful in certain contexts. This could be measured by running benchmarks and comparing the performance of different languages in specific tasks or scenarios.  Overall, defining the power of programming languages is a complex and multifaceted issue that may require considering multiple factors and criteria. It may be helpful to combine different measures and considerations to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different languages.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "The notion you are looking for is called expressiveness and Matthias Felleisen has a mathematically rigorous definition:  \"On the Expressive Power of Programming Languages\" www.ccs.neu.edu/scheme/pubs/scp91-felleisen.ps.gz (Postscript version)  The intuition behind the idea is that if you have two equivalent programs in two different languages-- say, program A in language X and program B in language Y-- and if you make a local change to A that requires a global change to B, then X is more expressive than Y. One example Felleisen provides is assignment: In the Scheme programming languages you can remove the assignment operator and still have a Turing complete language. However, in such a restricted language, adding in a feature that would be localized if assignment was allowed would require a global change to the program without assignment. My discussion has simplified some details, and you should read the paper itself for the full account. To answer your other question: You can say that Java is more expressive than assembly because you can add a new class to your Java program, and then gain the benefits of polymorphism by having other parts of your program call its methods without global modification. Exception handling is another example where Java is more expressive than assembly: You simply need to write a single throw statement to transfer control up the stack. On a more elementary level, you can also add a new case statement near the beginning of a switch and you won't have to worry about recalculating any jump offsets by hand. ",

        "Question": "For decades, the accepted degree to get to become a software developer was \"Compter Science.\" We've had a few questions already about whether that degree really prepares students to develop software. Some schools have, in the last 8 years or so, started offering multiple distinct majors in programming.  Using the curriculum from my school:  Computer Science, which starts out with some intro programming courses in the first year, and then focuses on theoretical computer science, algorithms, and a bit of OS stuff.  Most classes involve several smaller projects and homeworks, done solo or in pairs. Software Engineering, which starts out with the same intro programming courses, does a few classes of theory, and then goes into software development practices (testing, process methodologies, sofware metrics, requirements gathering) and software design (distributed system design, info system design, real-time/embedded design, subsystem design, etc)  Different schools do it differently, so the above is just a real-world example I'm familiar with.  What I ask is: Is there a need for distinct majors in programming? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There is definitely a need for distinct majors in programming, as the skills and knowledge required for software development go beyond just knowing how to program. Computer Science majors may have a solid foundation in theoretical aspects of computing, but they may not necessarily be equipped with the practical skills and knowledge needed to succeed in a software development role.  Software Engineering majors, on the other hand, are specifically focused on software development practices, design principles, and project management. They are trained in methodologies and best practices in software development, which are essential for building reliable, scalable, and maintainable software systems.  Having distinct majors in programming allows students to specialize in different aspects of software development, depending on their interests and career goals. It also helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice, by providing students with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in the rapidly evolving field of software development.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Yes, they should be. The relationship between computer science and software engineering is the same as the relationship between physics and mechanical engineering. One provides the theoretical background while the other takes those theories, along with good engineering principles, and applies them to the design and implementation of software. You need both in order to produce new and better software. A good computer science education trains people to produce new and better algorithms, data structures, programming languages and paradigms, compilers, and a number of other things that can be used to enhance software systems. A good software engineering education, on the other hand, trains you to take these tools and knowledge obtained through a scientific study of computation, along with a knowledge of the software development lifecycle and process models to actually build the system that a customer wants and needs.

        "Question": "In my current job it feels like we have a lot requirement changes. We are an \"Agile\" shop, so I get that we are supposed to adjust and what not, but sometime the change is large and nothing trivial.  My question is, how do you effectively communicate the cost of the change? Because of being agile, if a change is big enough something will get dropped from the current sprint, but it usually just get added next time around. Since our model is SaaS, the end customer is effectively the business itself, and they know they will get the cut feature n weeks later. I guess what I am trying to get at is the removal of a feature really isn't anything to use for communication as it was only delayed by n weeks. What other ways do you have to get the business to understand what a change costs? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One way to effectively communicate the cost of a change is to quantify it in terms of resources, time, and impact on the overall project timeline. This can include detailing the amount of work that will need to be re-done, the additional hours that will need to be put in, and any potential delays to the project delivery.  It may also be helpful to provide examples or case studies of past changes and their impact on the project, such as increased development time, decreased productivity, or increased costs. This can help the business understand the potential consequences of making large changes mid-sprint.  Additionally, offering alternative solutions or compromises that can help mitigate the cost of the change can be beneficial. This can include prioritizing certain features over others, adjusting the project timeline, or reallocating resources to accommodate the change.  Overall, open and honest communication is key when it comes to conveying the cost of changes to the business. By providing clear and detailed information, as well as offering potential solutions, you can help the business make informed decisions about whether or not to proceed with the change.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "@Joe \"We are an \"Agile\" shop, so I get that we are supposed to adjust and what not, but sometime the change is large and nothing trivial. \" If your process doesn't allow you to control the rate of change in requirements, your process is not agile, but haphazard. Agile does not mean \"taking anything that comes my way.\" To control requirement change/creep you can adopt - in your process - the notion that a requirement does not change (a notion that it's at the heart of Scrum.) Treat a requirement change as replacing an old requirement with a new one. You have to have a backlog of requirements, and you have to have the user choose which ones he/she wants to have implemented.  You wanted X and Y in two weeks, but all of the sudden you want Z. Well, then I can deliver you all three in 4 weeks. Or I can give a pair (X and Z) or (X and Y) or (Y and Z) in two weeks and deliver the remaining one later. Choose. This is how you negotiate with customers. This is how you communicate the cost of requirement change. If your group does not have that power, you are not in an agile shop, and there is nothing that you can do about it. It sucks, but it's true. In case where you can negotiate, you have to track (with precision) the time it takes to implement requirements and requirement changes. That is, you have to collect this data from past and present projects.  You collect the original time estimate and the actual completion time (in addition to resources like developer count) per request (or module affected by N requests). Better yet, estimate the size of the request/request change (in terms of lines of code or function points in past projects and requests.) Say you  have a metric that you can talk to the user with. You know that a new request will take, say, 1K lines of code, or 10 web pages with an average of 5 input fields each (50 function points).  Then by looking at historical data specific to your past projects (some by lines of codes, some by web pages, some by actual function points), and you can estimate how each of these cost in terms of absolute completion time. For those with sufficient data, you can also identify those requirements that track an actual developer head count.  Then you use that and you tell your customer that based on historical data; you argue that project failures tend to follow a exponential distribution follow; and then you are armed with the following argument for your customer:  Based on data from our past and present projects and available   resources, the requirement you are asking will take   X amount of time to complete with a 25% probability of failure (or   75% of success) 1.5 * X amount of time to complete with a 5% of failure (or 95% of success) 0.5 * X amount of time to complete with a 95% of failure (or 5% of success)   The probability of failure as a function of amount of time resources typically go 95%, 25% and 5% (resembling an exponential distro.) You convey the message that a certain baseline amount gives a somewhat decent chance of success (but with real risks). 1.5 of that might give almost a certain chance of success with minimal risk, but than much less than that (0.5 of the original guarantees almost certain failure.) You let them digest on that. If they still go for the risky proposition (done yesterday!) at least you have in writing that you told them so. If there is hope for your group of not just being agile but engineering-like, then, the customer might put serious consideration into your numbers and schedule this and future requests accordingly. It is your job as an engineer to explain in engineer, verifiable and clear terms that request changes are not a free meal. ",

        "Question": "This goes back to a conversation I've had with my girlfriend. I tried to tell her that I simply don't feel adequate enough in my programming language (C++) to call myself good. She then asked me, \"Well, when do you consider yourself good enough?\" That's an interesting question. I didn't know what to tell her. So I'm asking you. For any programming language, framework or the like, when do you reach a point were you sit back, look at what you've done and say, \"Hey, I'm actually pretty good at this.\"? How do you define \"good\" so that you can tell others, honestly, \"Yeah, I'm good at X\". Additionally, do you reach these conclusions by comparing what others can do? Additional Info I have read the canonical paper on how it takes ten-thousand hours before you are an expert on the field. (Props to anybody that knows what this paper is called again) I have also read various articles from Coding Horror about interviewing people. Some people, it was said, \"Cannot function outside of a framework.\" So they may be \"good\" for that framework, but not otherwise in the language. Is this true?  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It's a great question and one that many people struggle with. I believe that being \"good\" at a programming language or framework is subjective and can vary depending on the individual and their goals. Some people may consider themselves good once they can efficiently solve complex problems, while others may feel they are good once they have a strong understanding of the language's syntax and features.  One way to gauge your proficiency in a programming language is to set personal goals and milestones for yourself. For example, you could aim to successfully complete a project or tackle a particularly difficult problem using the language. As you achieve these goals, you may start to feel more confident in your abilities and consider yourself good at the language.  When it comes to comparing yourself to others, it's important to remember that everyone has different levels of experience and expertise. It's not productive to constantly measure yourself against others, as there will always be someone who knows more or has more experience than you. Instead, focus on your own growth and development in the language, and strive to continually improve and learn new things.  In terms of the ten-thousand-hour rule, it's worth noting that becoming an expert in a programming language doesn't necessarily mean you have to reach that exact number of hours. It's more about putting in the time and effort to continually practice and improve your skills. It's also important to be adaptable and willing to learn new things, rather than getting stuck in a rut with a particular framework or set of tools.  Ultimately, defining what it means to be \"good\" at a programming language is a personal journey, and it's up to you to determine when you feel confident enough to call yourself good. Trust in your abilities, continue learning and growing, and don't be afraid to push yourself outside of your comfort zone to reach new levels of proficiency.",

Further, the numbers represent a unit-less value of effort, whose value is determined by a baseline task that everyone agrees equals about a 1, and all else is relative to that. Ultimately, the goal is to get a good feel for a given team's \"velocity\", which is the number of these points that can be completed in a given iteration.  With that, it's possible to make reasonably accurate estimates of how long any given feature will take.  We did this at iteration planning meetings at one company I worked at, and I thought it was one of the few good things about that particular company.

        "Stack Overflow best answer": "We use it in our company for the project I'm involved in.  Some notes about planning poker are expressed in my recent blog post, and here's a bigger list of why it's cool:  It makes everyone agree.  People are not forced to accept any result; instead they're forced to make their own estimate!  The time to defend their own estimates is also allocated, if it's necessary. It keeps everyone busy.  You can't slack during the meeting, while trying to show that you're so involved. Also, necessity of moving your hands constitutes a good physical exercise to keep you off of sleeping. However, a downside of this is that sometimes you do need to do something else (for example, take some notes and write down the details of the agreement you've just reached).   It keeps meetings faster.  There's no need for a constant involvement of a meeting leader to keep everything on pace.  The game with clear rules is way better for that.  Yes, you need to make some extra moves to put cards on, reveal them, et cetera, but these pay their way. A lot of people just like to play cards, especially poker :-)  This increases motivation.

        "Question": "I'm posting this here since programmers write viruses, and AV software.  They also have the best knowledge of heuristics and how AV systems work (cloaking etc). The EICAR test file was used to functionally test an antivirus system.  As it stands today almost every AV system will flag EICAR as being a \"test\" virus.  For more information on this historic test virus please click here. Currently the EICAR test file is only good for testing the presence of an AV solution, but it doesn't check for engine file or DAT file up-to-dateness. In other words, why do a functional test of a system that could have definition files that are more than 10 years old.  With the increase of zero day threats it doesn't make much sense to functionally test your system using EICAR. That being said, I think EICAR needs to be updated/modified to be effective test that works in conjunction with an AV management solution. This question is about real world testing, without using live viruses... which is the intent of the original EICAR. That being said I'm proposing a new EICAR file format with the appendage of an XML blob that will conditionally cause the Antivirus engine to respond. X5O!P%@AP[4\\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-EXTENDED-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H* <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <engine-valid-from>2010-1-1Z</engine-valid-from> <signature-valid-from>2010-1-1Z</signature-valid-from> <authkey>MyTestKeyHere</authkey>   In this sample, the antivirus engine would only alert on the EICAR file if both the signature  or engine file is equal to or newer than the valid-from date. Also there is a passcode that will protect the usage of EICAR to the system administrator. If you have a backgound in \"Test Driven Design\" TDD for software you may get that all I'm doing is applying the principals of TDD to my infrastructure.   Based on your experience and contacts how can I make this idea happen? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One way to make this idea happen is to reach out to antivirus software vendors directly. You can contact their customer support or security teams to discuss your proposal and see if they would be interested in implementing it in their systems. It may also be helpful to present your idea at security conferences or forums where professionals in the field can provide feedback and potentially support your initiative. Additionally, collaborating with other experts in the cybersecurity industry who share your vision for improving antivirus testing methods could help bring attention and resources to the project. Keep in mind that implementing changes to widely-used systems like antivirus software may involve a significant amount of coordination and testing, so persistence and patience will be key in bringing your idea to fruition.",

        "Question": "I've been working in the enterprise space for the past 4\u00bd years and have noticed that generally speaking, enterprises are not conducive environments for the test-first style of development. Projects are usually fixed-cost, fixed-timeline and waterfall style. Any unit testing, if done at all, usually comes after development in the QA phase and done by another team. Prior to working for an enterprise, I consulted for many small to medium sized companies, and none of them were willing to pay for a test-first style of development project. They usually wanted development started immediately, or after a short design stint: i.e., something more akin to Agile, though some clients wanted everything mapped out similar to waterfall. With what types of shops, companies, and clients does test-driven development work best? What types of projects tend to be conducive to TDD? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Test-driven development (TDD) tends to work best in environments that value quality and collaboration throughout the development process. This approach is most effective in Agile environments where there is a focus on iterative development, quick feedback loops, and continuous improvement.  Smaller companies and startups, particularly those in industries such as software development, technology, and startups, are often more open to TDD as they tend to prioritize innovation and efficiency. These types of companies typically have more flexibility and are willing to invest in practices that can improve code quality and speed up the development process in the long run.  Projects that are well-suited for TDD are those where requirements are likely to change over time, where a high level of quality and reliability is required, and where collaboration between developers, testers, and stakeholders is important. TDD is particularly beneficial for projects that involve complex logic, integration with other systems, and where there is a need for extensive testing to ensure the functionality and performance of the software.  In summary, TDD is best suited for environments that value quality, collaboration, and iterative development, and projects that require flexibility, adaptability, and a high level of reliability. While it may not be suitable for all companies and projects, adopting TDD can significantly improve the quality, efficiency, and maintainability of software development.",

But not as a friendly suggestion, but bordering on a commandment. Often repeating the same advice over and over like a overzealous parrot. Personally, I like to reinvent the wheel when I'm learning, or even just for fun, even if it turns out worse than what's been done before. But this person apparently cannot fathom recreating ANY utility for such purposes, or possibly try something that doesn't strictly follow traditional OOP practices, and will settle for nothing except their sense of perfection, and thus naturally heave their criticism sludge down my ears full force.

If the person continues to be insistent or challenging, you could gently remind them that ultimately, it is your project and you have the final say in how it is executed. It's important to stick to your guns and not let someone else's criticism derail your creative process.  Ultimately, it's important to remember that not everyone will share your vision or approach, and that's okay.

        "Question": "I am referring to explaining to the non-programmer what programming is. I made sure to search for similar questions before creating this one, but the few ones I did find seemed to dodge the question, and I specifically would like to see some metaphors or analogies. I personally find it easier to explain something technical to someone through the use of metaphors or analogies. The reason I'm interested in this is because many people encounter the work of a programmer on a daily basis, but if you ask the average person what a programmer is or does, they don't really know. This leads to certain situations of misunderstanding (ex. \"[...] but I thought you were good with computers!\") I really would like to find the best one out there. I would like to be able to easily explain to someone what my career choice is about. Of course, at least the general idea. I personally don't have a solid one, but I have long thought about it and I have usually gravitated towards the 'language' metaphor, where we happen to know a language that computers understand, and therefore we are able to tell computers what to do, or \"teach\" them, to solve our problems. For example:  Imagine that in an alternate reality, humanoid robots with artificial intelligence exist, and some people are able to communicate with them through a common language, which is a variation of English. These people who can communicate with the robots are able to teach them how to solve certain problems or do certain tasks, like doing our chores. Well, although robots like that don't exist yet, programmers of our time are like those people, but instead of communicating with the robots, they communicate with computers. Programmers \"teach\" the computers how to perform certain tasks or solve certain problems by means of software which they create by using this \"common language\". Programmers and this \"common language\" are what give us things like email, websites, video games, word processors, smart phones (to put it simply), and many other things which we use on a daily basis.  I don't mean to put programming on the throne or anything, it's just the best metaphor I could come up with. I'm sure someone will find some issue with this one, it's probably a bit contrived, but then again that's why I'm asking this question. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "I like the \"common language\" metaphor you provided, as it does a good job of simplifying the concept of programming for someone who may not be familiar with it.   Another metaphor I've heard is comparing programming to giving instructions to a robot. Just like how you would give step-by-step instructions to a robot to perform a task, programmers write code to give instructions to a computer to perform a task. The computer follows these instructions to complete the task, just like a robot would.  Another analogy that is often used is comparing programming to cooking. Just like how a chef follows a recipe to create a dish, a programmer writes code to create a program. The code is like the recipe, giving the computer instructions on what to do to achieve the desired end result.  Ultimately, programming is about using a language that computers can understand to create software that can perform tasks or solve problems. It's a creative and problem-solving process that allows us to harness the power of technology to improve our lives.",

We intend to charge for commercial use of the framework, but make it free for open source/non-commercial use.  The rough plan at the moment is to administer this through some form of fairly simple licence which will be issued whether you\u2019re using it for free or paying. We\u2019re debating whether to make the source code available.  It\u2019s our perception (and our own preference) that it\u2019s far more appealing to use something where you have access to the source code. I\u2019m interested in whether people think making the source code available will damage our ability to make money from the framework, or whether it will encourage more usage and enough \u201cgood\u201d people will arrange to pay for the correct licence if using it commercially. My feeling is that, generally, commercial operations don\u2019t mess about on the licencing front and so making the source code available will only encourage usage and therefore ultimately generate more revenue, but I\u2019d be interested in others views/experience. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Making the source code available can actually increase the attractiveness of your framework to potential users. In the open-source community, having access to the source code is highly valued as it allows for greater customization, troubleshooting, and understanding of how the framework works.   By making the source code available, you are demonstrating transparency and trust in your product, which can build goodwill and credibility with users. This could potentially lead to more widespread adoption and use of your framework, which could in turn result in more commercial users and revenue.  Additionally, making the source code available does not necessarily mean that users will not pay for a commercial license. Many commercial operations understand the value of paying for a product that they rely on for their business, and will do so to ensure they are using it legally and to support the continued development and maintenance of the framework.  Overall, making the source code available can be a strategic move that benefits both users and your business. It can encourage more usage and adoption of your framework, while still allowing for a revenue stream through commercial licenses.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "You should definitely make the source available.  Whether it's freely available or only available to those who buy a license is up to you, but I would never use a third-party library with no source.

(Yes, even yours.)  I've used a lot of different libraries, from different people and written in different languages, and I can't think of any that I've never needed the source from at one point or another. If you want to do it right, add a provision in the license like what the GPL and MPL have, that if they make changes to the code and end up publishing a product using it, they have to publish the changes they made. That way you get free bugfixes and (potential) features just by letting other people use your code. ",

        "ChatGpt answer": "Background: The bug occurred in a web application written in Java, using Spring framework, and running on a Linux server. The bug was discovered during user acceptance testing, where users reported unexpected behavior when trying to upload images to the application.  The Hunting: The plan was to first identify and reproduce the bug in a local development environment. This involved working closely with the QA team and users to gather detailed steps to reproduce the issue. One of the difficulties encountered was that the bug was not consistently reproducible and only occurred under certain conditions. The offending code was finally found by stepping through the code using a debugger and analyzing the stack traces.  The Killing: The fix involved modifying the image processing code to handle certain edge cases that were causing the unexpected behavior. The scope of the fix was determined by analyzing the code paths that were leading to the issue. The fix was relatively complex as it involved refactoring and adding additional error handling to the code. Approximately 200 lines of code were involved in the fix.  Postmortem: The root cause technically was a race condition in the image processing code that was not handled properly. From a high-level perspective, the bug was caused by a lack of proper error handling and testing in the image upload feature. The process ultimately took about a week to identify, fix, test, and deploy the solution. Thankfully, no other features were adversely affected by the fix.  What was particularly helpful in this process was collaboration with the QA team and users to understand the issue, as well as using a debugger to step through the code. One tool that was particularly useless was a code analysis tool that did not catch the race condition.

However, we had dozens of other users who never saw the issue despite using the application for the same task for most of the work day. Also there was one user in particular who got it a lot more frequently than the rest of them. We tried the usual steps:  (1) Had them switch computers with another user who never had the problem to rule out the computer/configuration. - The problem followed them. (2) Had them log into the application and work as a user that never saw the problem. - The problem STILL followed them. (3) Had the user report which image they were viewing and set up a test harness to repeat viewing that image thousands of times in quick succession. The problem did not present itself in the harness.   (4) Had a developer sit with the users and watch them all day. They saw the errors, but didn't notice them doing anything out of the ordinary to cause them. We struggled with this for weeks trying to figure out what the \"Error Users\" had in common that the other users didn't. I have no idea how, but the developer in step (4) had a eureka moment on the drive in to work one day worthy of Encyclopedia Brown. He realized that all the \"Error Users\" were left handed, and confirmed this fact. Only left-handed users got the errors, never Righties. But how could being left handed cause a bug? We had him sit down and watch the left-handers again specifically paying attention to anything they might be doing differently, and that's how we found it. It turned out that the bug only happened if you moved the mouse to rightmost column of pixels in the image viewer while it was loading a new image (overflow error because the vendor had a 1-off calculation for mouseover event).  Apparently, while waiting for the next image to load, the users all naturally moved their hand (and thus the mouse)  towards the keyboard.  The one user who happened to get the error most frequently was one of those ADD types that compulsively moved her mouse around a lot impatiently while waiting for the next page to load, thus she was moving the mouse to the right much more quickly and hitting the timing just right so she did it when the load event happened. Until we got a fix from the vendor, we told her just to let go of the mouse after clicking (next document) and not touch it until it loaded.

        "Question": "There's around a zillion \"PHP frameworks\". And most of them bill themselves as following the MVC pattern. While it's welcome to overcome osCommerce coding style (processing logic heavily intermixed with SQL and HTML), there are certainly simpler and easier to follow approaches to get a maintainable application design. The original MVC concept was targetted at GUI applications. And for Gtk/Python it seems feasible to follow it accordingly. But PHP web apps don't operate on live Views (GUI elements) and a persistent Controller runtime. It's quite certainly a misnomer if it just describes the used code + directory grouping or class naming. \"MVC\" seems to be used like a buzzword for PHP frameworks. And I've actually seen one or two mature PHP frameworks admit it, but redefining the phrase anyway to match interna. So is it generally snake oil? Why isn't better terminology used, and a more sensible concept for maintainable PHP propagated? Some elaborative reasoning Why I suspect that PHP implementations don't follow the real MVC pattern: Models: in theory, Models should be fat and contain business logic, and controllers should be thin handlers (input->output). In reality the PHP frameworks advocate shallow Models. CI and Symfony for example equate Model == ORM. Even HTTP input is handled by the controller, isn't treated as model. Views: workarounds with AJAX discounted, there can't be Views on web pages. PHP frameworks still pump out pages. The interface still effectively follows the ordinary HTTP model, there's no advantage over non-MVC applications. (And lastly, none of the widespread php frameworks can factually output to GUI Views instead of HTML. I've seen a PHP library that can operate Gtk/Console/Web, but the frameworks don't.) Controller: I'm unsure. Controllers probably don't need to be long-running and persistently active in the MVC model. In PHP framework context, they're however mostly request handlers. Not really something to get argumentative about, but it just feels slightly buzzwordish. Would there be better descriptors? I've seen acronyms like PMVC or HMVC thrown around. Though descriptions get more ambigous there, maybe these would describe the current web frameworks less hokey? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It is true that many PHP frameworks claim to follow the MVC pattern without fully adhering to its principles. This can lead to confusion and a lack of clarity in application design.   One reason for this mismatch could be that the MVC pattern was originally designed for GUI applications, where the View and Controller are separate entities that interact with each other in real-time. In the case of PHP web applications, the View is typically static HTML generated by the server, and the Controller is more of a request handler that deals with input and output. This does not align perfectly with the original MVC concept.  Additionally, some PHP frameworks do not fully embrace the idea of fat Models and thin Controllers. In many cases, the Model is equated to an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and may not contain much business logic. This goes against the core principle of the MVC pattern.  In light of these discrepancies, there have been suggestions for alternative descriptors such as PMVC (Presentation Model View Controller) or HMVC (Hierarchical Model View Controller). These terms may better reflect the way PHP frameworks actually operate and could provide a more accurate description of their architecture.  Ultimately, the use of the term \"MVC\" in the context of PHP frameworks may be more of a marketing ploy or buzzword than an accurate representation of their design. It is important for developers to understand the underlying principles of application architecture and choose the framework or approach that best suits their needs.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I think you are looking at this in completely the wrong way. A GUI app and a web page are worlds apart so the exact same definition of MVC will never work for both. MVC is more about the ideal: separating certain parts of the app like display and logic. In PHP (or the web in general), a View is the web page itself: the HTML output. It's not \"live\" as per your definition, but you simply click links to go back to the controller (i.e. another page request). The Controller and Model is where things do differ, like you explained. In PHP the model tends to be the data layer, interacting with the database and so on. But it is still modelling the situation, and the controller still controls the application flow, if only once per page load. So the name \"Model-View-Controller\" is perfectly logical, albeit a different implementation in GUI apps vs web apps. ",

        "ChatGpt answer": "As a software developer, it is important to always consider certain principles, values, standards, and rules of behavior when writing code. However, there are times when these ethical guidelines may be overruled by business requirements, lack of technical skills, or other friction during the development process.  For example, let's consider the scenario of accepting known bugs as a risk for the end-user. While it is unethical to knowingly release software with bugs that could potentially harm the end-user, there may be instances where business pressures or tight deadlines force developers to make a difficult decision. In this case, it is important for the development team to prioritize addressing critical bugs and communicating any known issues to end-users to minimize the risk.  On the other hand, when it comes to securing and encrypting private data delivered to end-users in web applications, there should be no compromise. Protecting user data is a fundamental ethical principle that should always be upheld, regardless of any external pressures.  Similarly, giving the end user the chance for a complete de-install, obtaining user consent before submitting data to the server, and refraining from sending unwanted emails are all ethical best practices that should be followed without exception.  When it comes to developing software for controversial industries such as the weapons industry or for potentially criminal activities, it becomes a more nuanced ethical dilemma. While it may be legal to develop software for these purposes, it is important for developers to carefully consider the potential impact of their work on society and whether they are comfortable with being associated with such projects.  In conclusion, while there may be instances where ethical guidelines are tested by business requirements or technical constraints, it is important for software developers to always prioritize the welfare of key stakeholders and adhere to ethical principles to the best of their abilities.

However, to address some of your particular points:  Do you accept known bugs as a risk for the end-user?  It depends. If it's a mission critical system and the bug is a showstopper, that's unacceptable. However, if it's a minor flaw that has workarounds in a non-critical system, that's acceptable. I always consider the impact of the problem on the system and to the users (and people affected by) the system.  Do you always secure and encrypt private data delivered end-users in your web application?  If I was on a project where this applied, I would consult any applicable laws and guidelines and follow them. If there were no applicable guidelines, I would err on the side of caution and use some form of security. Of course, you have to weigh a number of factors, ranging from how the system is deployed (physical locations, connections between nodes) and performance of any algorithms or techniques used.  Did you ever write software that is legal but morally controversial, like for weapons industry.  All of my jobs (as you can see in my profile) have been in the defense industry (and I'm also planning on working in the defense or intelligence industries after graduation), including work on ISR systems and Command and Control systems. I don't understand anyone, especially really good software engineers with skills that these projects need, who says that they won't build such systems. The way I see it, by bringing the best software engineering practices to these systems, you are only making them safer and more reliable. And these systems that involve life and death need to be as safe and reliable as possible. ",

You've found yourself in one of the most lucrative fields in the world.  A business with 99% profit margin, where you have no physical product but can name your price; a business where you can ship a buggy product and the customer will still buy it. Occasionally some of our software will get a free competitor, and I think, this guy is crazy.  He could be making a good living off of this but instead chose to make it free.    Do you not like giant piles of money? Are you not confident that people would pay for it?   Are you afraid of having to support it?  It's bad for the business of programming because now customers expect to be able to find a free solution to every problem. (I see tweets like \"is there any good FREE software for XYZ? or do I need to pay $20 for that\".) It's also bad for customers because the free solutions eventually break (because of a new OS or what have you) and since it's free, the developer has no reason to fix it. Customers end up with free but stale software that no longer works and never gets updated. Customer cries. Developer still working day job cries in their cubicle. What gives?

Passion and goodwill: Many developers are passionate about their work and want to contribute to the community by sharing their creations for free. They may enjoy the process of developing software and want to see others benefit from their hard work.  2. Building a reputation: By offering free software, developers can build a positive reputation in the industry and gain recognition for their skills and expertise. This can lead to opportunities for paid projects or collaborations in the future.  3. Marketing and exposure: Offering a free version of software can be a way to attract users and build a customer base. Once users see the value of the software, they may be more likely to purchase a premium version or additional features.  4. Learning and growth: Some developers may choose to release their software for free as a way to learn and improve their skills. By sharing their work with others, they can receive feedback and suggestions for improvement.  Ultimately, the decision to release software for free is a personal one and may vary depending on the developer's goals and motivations.

My question is what amount of time can one expect to devote to a software project's bugs in relation to the original development time. I realize there are a huge number of determining factors that go into but I was hoping for a typical or average breakdown.  For example, if Project A takes 40 hours to complete and an additional 10 fixing bugs then this project would have a 4:1 ratio. If another Project (B) takes 10 hours to complete but another 8 on bugs then it would have a 5:4 ratio.  Is this a documented/researched concept? UPDATE Thanks for all the informative answers. I understand that it's impossible to put a standard to this kind of metric due to all the variables and environmental factors involved. Before I assign an answer I'd like to know if this metric has an agreed-upon name so I can do further research. I would like to get to a point where I can understand the measurements necessary to generate the metrics myself and eventually come up with a baseline standard for my project. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "The concept you are referring to is often called the \"bug-to-code ratio\" or \"defect density.\" This ratio represents the number of bugs found in a software project in relation to the lines of code written. As you mentioned, there is no standard or average breakdown for this ratio as it can vary greatly depending on the complexity of the project, the experience of the developers, the quality of testing, and many other factors.   If you are interested in further research on this topic, I would recommend looking into software quality metrics and defect management practices. There are various tools and methodologies available to measure and track bugs in software projects, such as bug tracking software, code review processes, and automated testing frameworks.   By implementing these practices in your project, you can start collecting data on bugs and code changes, which will help you analyze the bug-to-code ratio and potentially establish a baseline standard for your own projects. Good luck with your research!",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "The equilibrium percentage of total capacity allocated to defect-fixing is equal to the defect injection rate. Many factors can affect this rate, among them, of course: what kind of product the team is developing, what technologies and technical practices they use, the team's skill level, the company culture, etc. Considering Team B, if they create on average 8 units of rework for every 10 units of work they complete, then working those 8 units will create new 6.4 units of rework.  We can estimate the total effort they will eventually have to expend as the sum of a geometric progression: 10 + 8 + 6.4 + 5.12 + ... The number of bugs will decrease exponentially with time, but Team B has such a coefficient in their exponent that it will go to zero very slowly.  Actually, the sum of the first three terms in the above series is only 24.4; of the first five, 33.6; of the first 10, 45; of the entire series, 50.  So, Team B summary: defect injection rate, 0.8; feature development, 10/50 = 20%; defect-fixing, 80%.  20/80 is their sustainable capacity allocation. By contrast, Team A is in much better shape.  Their progression looks like this: 40 + 10 + 2.5 + 0.625 + ... The sum of this series is 53 1/3, so Team A's feature development allocation is 40/(53 1/3) = 75% and defect-fixing allocation is 25%, which matches their defect injection rate of 10/40 = 0.25. Actually, all terms in Team A's series after the first three are negligibly small.  What this means in practical terms is that Team A can probably squash all their bugs with a couple of maintenance releases, the second release being pretty small in scope.  This also creates an illusion that any team can do that.  But not Team B. I thought about this equivalence while reading David Anderson's new book, \"Kanban\".  (The book is on a different subject, but addresses quality concerns, too.)  When discussing software quality, Anderson quotes this book, by Capers Jones, \"Software Assessments, Benchmarks, and Best Practices\": \"...in 2000... measured software quality for North American teams... ranged from 6 defects per function point down to less than 3 per 100 function points, a range of 200 to 1.  The midpoint is approximately 1 defect per 0.6 to 1.0 function points.  This implies that it is common for teams to spend more than 90 percent of their effort fixing defects.\"  He cites an example provided by one of his colleagues of a company that spends 90% of the time fixing their bugs. The fluency with which Anderson goes from the defect injection rate to the defext-fixing capacity allocation (failure demand is the term for it) suggests that the equivalence of the two things is well known to software quality researchers and has probably been known for some time. The key words in the line of reasoning that I'm trying to present here are \"equlibrium\" and \"sustainable\".  If we take away sustainability, then there's an obvious way to cheat these numbers: you do the initial coding, then move on to code somewhere else, and leave maintenance to others.  Or you run up the technical debt and unload it on a new owner. Obviously, no particular allocation will suit all teams.  If we decreed that 20% must be spent on bugs, then, if a team has an ultra-low defect injection rate, they will simply not have enough bugs to fill the time, and if a team had a very high rate, their bugs will continue to accumulate. The math I used here is way simplified.  I neglected things like transaction costs (planning and estimation meetings, post-mortems, etc.), which would affect the percentages somewhat.  I also omitted equations simulating sustaining one product and developing another one concurrently.  But the conclusion still stands.  Do what you can, in terms of technical practices, like unit-testing, continuous integration, code reviews, etc., to reduce your defect injection rate and, consequently, your failure demand.  If you can create only one bug for every 10 features, you will have a lot of free time to develop new features and satisfy your customers. ",

It was free to ignore them, so you could fail late and produce hard-to-debug code. Then came exceptions. Those were made impossible to ignore once they occur, and most people (except Joel) like them better. And now we got libraries that help parallel code. Problem is, you can't handle exceptions in parallel code as easily as you could with non-parallel code. If you asynchronously launch a task and it throws an exception, there's no stack trace past it to unwind; best you can do is capture it and register it on the task object, if there's such an object. However, it defeats the primary strength of exceptions: you have to check for them and you can ignore them without any additional effort, whereas in single-threaded code an exception will necessarily trigger the appropriate actions (even if it means terminating your program). How should language implementations or libraries support errors in parallel code? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One approach to handling errors in parallel code is to use a combination of exceptions and some sort of logging or error reporting mechanism. When an exception is thrown in a parallel task, it can be caught and logged or reported in some way to ensure that it doesn't go unnoticed.  Another option is to use a more structured approach to error handling in parallel code, such as using a separate error handling mechanism that is specifically designed for parallel code. This could involve using constructs like Futures or Promises, which allow for more explicit error handling in parallel code.  Additionally, language implementations or libraries could provide tools and utilities specifically designed for handling errors in parallel code, such as debugging and profiling tools that make it easier to track down and troubleshoot errors in parallel tasks.

Can someone explain unit testing to me, and how to set it up in a Visual Studio 2010 solution that has multiple projects? Is it something that occurs within your project's solution, or is it a separate solution? And is it something you'd recommend for a small development team or is it just a waste of time to setup?

        "ChatGpt answer": "Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation from the rest of the application. The main goal of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. By testing individual units in isolation, developers can identify and fix bugs early in the development process.  Setting up unit testing in Visual Studio 2010 is relatively straightforward. You can add a new unit test project to your solution by right-clicking on the solution in the Solution Explorer and selecting Add > New Project. From there, you can choose the type of unit testing project you want to create (e.g. MSTest or NUnit).  Once you have added a unit testing project to your solution, you can start writing unit tests for your code. Unit tests are typically written as methods that test specific functionality or behavior of a unit of code. You can run these unit tests using a test runner provided by Visual Studio, which will automatically execute your tests and provide feedback on whether they pass or fail.  As for whether unit testing is beneficial for a small development team, the answer is a resounding yes. Unit testing can help you catch bugs early in the development process, improve code quality, and make it easier to refactor code without breaking existing functionality. While it may require some upfront investment in setting up and writing tests, the long-term benefits of unit testing far outweigh the initial effort.  In conclusion, I would highly recommend setting up unit testing in your Visual Studio solution, especially if you are working on a larger project with multiple projects and dependencies. Unit testing can help you improve code quality, catch bugs early, and make it easier to maintain your codebase in the long run.",

Personally, I'm not a huge fan of such \"literal\" method names, and prefer to be succint, while still being as clear as possible.

It's important to remember that interviews are not just about getting the right answer, but also about how you approach the problem and communicate your thought process.   In terms of coding, it's definitely important to prioritize getting the algorithm right before worrying about coding conventions or making the code look perfect. However, it's also important to pay attention to details like exception handling, as they can show your attention to detail and problem-solving skills.  In your case, it sounds like you had a good understanding of the algorithm and were able to come up with a working solution in a short amount of time, which is impressive. To improve for next time, you could focus on practicing writing clean and well-structured code, as well as paying attention to details like exception handling.

I feel that the requirements should be sufficient for giving the information needed for testers to create their tests.

This seemed weird at first, but being a lazy cat I actually did it, and it turns out I find this pretty useful :     no need to check if all files were saved before running a compiler/interpreter forces you to make granular commits much more regularly  My editor has been behaving this way for a couple of days, I never had such a clean commit history, and didn't get burned yet.  In the days of DVCS when by saving we actually mean commit, do you think that manually saving files is still a relevant practice ? ",

Some developers may prefer manually saving files for various reasons such as control over when changes are saved, reducing the risk of accidentally committing unfinished code, or simply out of habit. On the other hand, automatic saving (and potentially automatically committing) can streamline the development process and eliminate the need to constantly remember to save files.  In the context of DVCS, manually saving files may still be relevant for those who want more control over their commits and prefer to make granular changes before committing. However, automatic saving and committing can also be beneficial for ensuring that changes are regularly backed up and avoiding the need to constantly remember to save files before running a compiler or interpreter.  Ultimately, the choice between manual saving and automatic saving/committing comes down to personal preference and the specific needs of the developer or team.

        "ChatGpt answer": "A hybrid drive can definitely help improve the performance of your PC, especially when it comes to reducing lag and load times for large programs like Visual Studio or web browsers with lots of tabs open.   Hybrid drives combine a traditional HDD with a small amount of solid-state storage, allowing for faster access to frequently used files and applications. This can help speed up overall system performance and decrease the lag you're experiencing with your current setup.  While a hybrid drive won't completely eliminate all performance issues, it can certainly help alleviate them to a significant degree.

It has been five years since Rails 1.0 was released for Ruby, and since that time we have seen Grails for Groovy, Django for Python, and Roo for Java. But to my knowledge (which is probably limited, being a Java/Groovy progammer) there is no similar framework for C#. Does such a thing exist?  If not, why not? Edit:  It's quite possible I'm not using the right words when I say \"rapid-development,\" but I'm talking about frameworks that can conceivably allow you to build a working blog engine in 30 minutes.  You couldn't reasonably do this with, say, Java, Spring, and Hibernate, given the various configuration needed to allow your controllers to be found, and both configuration and code necessary for your entities to persist and be retrieved.   So I'm talking about frameworks that handle all of the CRUD with a convention-over-configuration mentality.  If someone has the right words for what I'm talking about, let me know. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "You are referring to what is commonly known as \"full-stack\" or \"opinionated\" web frameworks, which handle a lot of the heavy lifting and configuration for you, allowing for rapid development of web applications. These frameworks typically follow the convention over configuration principle and provide tools and patterns for common tasks such as CRUD operations, routing, and templating.  In the C# ecosystem, one such framework that fits this description is ASP.NET Core with Entity Framework Core. ASP.NET Core is a modern, cross-platform web framework for building web applications, and Entity Framework Core is a lightweight and extensible ORM framework for accessing databases. Together, they provide a robust toolset for building web applications quickly and efficiently.  Additionally, there are other C# frameworks and libraries that can help speed up development, such as NancyFX, ServiceStack, and Dapper. These frameworks focus on simplicity, performance, and ease of use, making them well-suited for rapid development.  In conclusion, while C# may not have a framework that is as widely recognized for rapid development as Rails or Django, there are tools and frameworks in the C# ecosystem that can help developers build web applications quickly and efficiently. It's important to explore and experiment with different frameworks to find the one that best fits your needs and preferences.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "It seems to me that there is no name yet for this kind of framework you are all talking about in this thread. I call them for the moment just RAILS-like Frameworks: Frameworks that increment productivity by orchestrating other existing frameworks with the purpose of solving the basic needs of most web applications, but at the same time hiding all the complexities from the developer. By basic needs I mean the implementation of a Persistence Provider, a Dependency Inyection Container, a Logging tool, an MVC platform, an HTML Template Engine, a Web Site Template Starter Kit with CSS presets, a Security Framework and some Javascript Library for AJAX features and other cool stuff. The RAILS-like Frameworks orchestrate all these frameworks and tools on the basis of the Domain model (the entities of your system with its attributes). Thanks to the Convention-over-Configuration principle, these frameworks avoid the need of defining lots of configuration files usually required by the frameworks they orchestrate (like Spring, Spring MVC, Hibernate, Log4J, etc.), assuming configurations by default based on naming, structure and metadata included in the same classes definitions. Thanks to the dynamic languages that these frameworks make use (like Ruby, Groovy, Python, Clojure, etc.), with the exception of SpringRoo that implements dynamic behaviour in Java by using AspectJ, the functionality that belongs to the frameworks underneath are extended and are made available to the developer in such a uniform and elegant manner that he/she is just aware of the underlying technologies. Finally thanks to the Scaffold technique, unit tests, integration tests, controllers and views are automatically generated for the main functions (CRUD) over each one of the domain objects defined by the developer. In the .NET world nothing has been developed yet, following all the previous definitions. But nothing prevents that from occurring soon. There are great frameworks, tools and libraries already available in the .NET world that can be orchestrated by a new RAILS-like framework made for the CLR. There are Unity, Spring.NET and Castle Windsor among others for the Dependency Inyection needs. Entity Framework 4, NHibernate and iBatis.NET are pretty good .NET Persistence Providers. ASP.NET MVC have strongly arrived with support for various Template Engines besides the traditional ASP.NET. Even if nobody achieves to use a DLR language to build this kind of framework, anyone with enough will can follow the SpringSource path and implement a RAILS-like framework with some static language like F#, C# or VB.NET, making use of an Aspect-Oriented Container (like AspectSharp or Gripper-LOOM.NET) to obtain dynamic behaviour.

You can also explain how involving you in the requirements and design process from the beginning can save time and prevent misunderstandings down the line.   You can also propose setting up regular meetings with the client, either in person or through virtual communication, where you can directly discuss their needs and clarify any questions you have. This can help streamline the process and ensure that everyone is on the same page.  Additionally, you can offer to provide regular updates and progress reports to the middlemen and the client, so they can see the value of your involvement in the project.  Overall, communication is key in these situations, so be open and honest about your concerns and offer practical solutions to improve the process for everyone involved. Good luck!",

        "Question": "Let me explain this a little. In a previous job, I had a coworker that has a good reputation with the management. He always finished on time. And the bosses were happy with his progress so het got certain privileges. The problem was that the other programmers knew his secret. He has optimized the 80/20 rule, so he worked his 20 percent time to finish 80 percent of the code. The other (hard) 20% was left to the maintenance programmers. Who (not surprisingly) got penalized because of their lack of progress. But because this programmer had a good reputation with the management, it was almost imposible to shift the blame to him. (Fortunately he left the company). My question is, what to do as programming team if you have such a programmer within your team. Do you try to warn management with risk of ruining your own chances? Do you accept the fact? Or are there other options. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It can be a difficult situation to navigate when you have a team member who is not pulling their weight and is taking advantage of the system. It is important to address this issue in a professional manner to ensure that the team's work is completed efficiently and fairly.  One option is to have a candid conversation with the team member in question to address the issue directly. It is possible that they may not realize the impact of their actions on the rest of the team and the project as a whole. By discussing the issue openly and constructively, you may be able to come to a resolution that benefits everyone involved.  If talking to the team member does not yield results, it may be necessary to bring the issue to management's attention. It is important to approach this conversation carefully and provide evidence of the team member's behavior in a professional manner. By bringing the issue to light, management may be able to take steps to address the situation and ensure that the workload is distributed fairly among the team members.  Ultimately, it is important to prioritize the success and efficiency of the team as a whole.

Some time later I have a business need to do something that wouldn't comply with the open source licence. Am I allowed to do that? How should I publish the software in a way that I keep ownership and don't block myself from using the library in the future in any way? Keep in mind that at least in theory, other developers may decide to contribute to my open-source project. Can I specify in a licence that I as the original developer get ownership of their contributions as well? Don't get me wrong here, I'm not trying to be evil and get ownership of other's work - I just want to keep ownership of mine, and if someone posts an important bugfix I could be rendered unable to use the original code unless I use his work as well. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "As the original creator of the library, you have the right to decide the licensing terms under which it is distributed. If you want to retain ownership and control over the library while still allowing others to use and contribute to it, you could consider using a dual licensing model. This means that the library is available under two different licenses - one open source license for the general public, and another commercial license for yourself or others who wish to use the library in a way that is not permitted under the open source license.  In terms of contributions from other developers, you can specify in the open source license that any contributions to the project are licensed back to you under the same terms as the original library. This means that you retain ownership and control over the entire project, including any contributions from others.  It is important to be transparent and clearly communicate your intentions and licensing terms to the community of developers who may contribute to your project. This will help prevent any misunderstandings or conflicts in the future.  Overall, by carefully selecting and clearly communicating the licensing terms of your open source project, you can retain ownership and control over your original work while still allowing others to use and contribute to it in a collaborative and open manner.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "You always keep ownership under open-source licenses.  The work you created is your property, and you can do whatever you want to with it, (within legal limits, of course,) including allowing other people to use it under the terms of an open-source license.  If you want to use it for a proprietary project, you're welcome to do so, unless you have completely turned over the rights to someone else by contract.  But this is not what open-source licenses do.  They're about sharing usefulness, not about giving up ownership. Things get a bit sticker once other people start contributing.  It's their work, then, not yours, and you need to get their permission.  One thing you can do is publish your library under a dual license.  That's what Sam Lantinga, the primary creator and maintainer of SDL, does.  Because Apple doesn't like dynamic link libraries for iOS, and complying with the LGPL in a statically linked app is more trouble than it's worth, he publishes SDL under both the LGPL and a commercial license for static iPhone apps.  When anyone submits a patch, he explicitly asks them for permission to deploy their patch in the library under both licenses, and if they don't like that, he doesn't add it to the codebase. EDIT: My example is no longer accurate.  A while back Sam changed the model (not sure why; maybe he just got tired of the administration hassles) and now licenses SDL under a highly permissive zlib-style license.  But he used to do it this way. ",

But I'm looking for a more specific gauge of experiences, something quantifiable or probably other programmer's average performances which I should aim for and base my estimates.  The answers range from weeks, and I was looking more for an answer on the level of a task assigned for a day or so. (Note that this doesn't include submitting for QA or documentations, just the actual development time from writing tests if I used TDD, to making the page, before having it submitted to testing) My current rate right now is as follows (on ASP.NET webforms):  Right now, I'm able to develop a simple data entry page with a grid listing (no complex logic, just Creating and Reading) on an already built architecture, given one full day's (8 hours) time.   Adding complex functionality, and Update and Delete pages add another full day to the task. If I have to start the page from scratch (no solution, no existing website) it takes me another full day. (Not always) but if I encounter something new or haven't done yet it takes me another full day.  Whenever I make an estimate that's longer than the expected I feel that others think that I'm lagging a lot behind everyone else. I'm just concerned as there have been expectations that when it's just one page it should take me no more than a full day. Yes, there definitely is more room for improvement.  There always is. I have a lot to learn. But I would like to know if my current rate is way too slow, just average, or average for someone no longer than a year in the industry.  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It's great that you are seeking to improve and learn from your experiences. It's also important to remember that everyone's pace and experience level are different, so it's not always fair to compare yourself to others directly.   From your description, it sounds like you are making progress and improving your speed with each task. Developing a simple data entry page with a grid listing in one full day is a good base to start from, especially considering you are still new to the industry.   As you gain more experience and familiarity with the technologies you are working with, you may find yourself becoming more efficient and faster at completing tasks. It's also important to factor in time for learning new things and overcoming challenges, as these are valuable learning experiences that will ultimately make you a better developer in the long run.   It might be helpful to keep track of your progress and set goals for yourself to gradually improve your speed and efficiency. Remember to communicate openly with your team about your progress and any challenges you may be facing, as this can help set realistic expectations and foster a supportive work environment.

        "Stack Overflow best answer": "If you're programming for a job, and your superiors are happy with the rate you're turning stuff out at, then I'd say you're doing fine.  As you've lasted a year, they're clearly not outraged with your output.  Also, you've only been there a year, and assuming they've been managing people for more than a day, they know that there's a learning curve when you're still green. As for estimates... I've been in the industry for 5 years now (certainly not veteran territory, I know!), and my personal estimates still suck.  I overestimate almost as often as I underestimate, and I do both far more than I get it right.  Something will come up, somewhere, and bite you.  Sometimes you'll find a library that does everything you thought you had to do yourself, and a week's work disappears in half a day.  Other times a stupid bug will stretch a day's work out to 2, 3, 4... If you're repeating a lot of the same work over and over, and you feel like you've maxed out your throughput on it, maybe you should ask to be moved to another task. 'Cross-pollination' and other PHB-friendly terms are definitely of benefit to devs.  If you spend a month or more on something else, maybe you'll find something you're better suited to.

        "Question": "So you take a contract where you have solid experience with 75% of the technology necessary.  How do you handle your time to learn the other 25%? Work it into the billing time?  Expose the 25% in the contract as 'research'?  Do the learning on my own time (not billed)?  Not take the contract (too large of an unknown for me and the customer)? On the extreme end of this, I keep hearing a story about Mark Cuban (Dallas billionaire who started broadcast.com and sold it to Yahoo!) when he was at Indiana University.  Someone asked him if he could build a business app for them and he immediately said \"Yes\"... he had no idea how.  So he bought a book, stayed up nights, studied and coded... He finished it (I'm sure it was ugly), it worked and he kept going. I'm not suggesting doing contracts this way (the stress!), but there's a middle ground.  What is it, and how would you (or would you?) bill for the unknown? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are a few different approaches that could be taken in this situation:  1. Incorporate the learning time into the billing time: This is a common approach where the time spent learning the new technology is factored into the overall project cost. This can be beneficial for both parties as it allows for the project to be completed successfully while also providing an opportunity for professional development.  2. Expose the 25% in the contract as 'research': By clearly outlining in the contract that a portion of the project will involve research and learning new technology, both parties are aware of the potential challenges and can work together to find a solution. This can help manage expectations and ensure that the project stays on track.  3. Do the learning on your own time (not billed): Some contractors may choose to invest their own time and resources into learning new technology in order to fulfill the contract requirements. While this can be a valuable learning experience, it is important to consider the potential impact on work-life balance and overall project timeline.  4. Not take the contract: If the unknown technology represents too large of a risk for both parties, it may be best to not take on the contract in order to avoid potential challenges and delays. It is important to assess the potential benefits and drawbacks of taking on the project before making a decision.  Ultimately, the best approach will depend on the specific circumstances of the contract and the preferences of both parties involved.

Now, if it's something obscure, I bill for it at my normal rate.  Some examples:  APIs and protocols which are not mainstream (industry specific, small 3rd party or just niche products); internal tools, configuration formats and services inside the client organization; a non-standard database schema, database query language or security model; etc. I've never had any objections about the way I do this, and I'm very transparent about it in my proposals.

If so, what factors are you considering. If you take a real TCO look at large ERP and/or consolidated application landscapes, mainframe is actually quite cost-effective. My own consultations have included recommendations for scale-up/mainframe/mid-size systems on some specific needs.  Honestly, I've never had a customer take said recommendation, rather defaulting to countless scale-out VMs on Intel boxen (in non-trivial cost) and yet still to this day have system management and performance issues. Curious your take on this.  We need to remember that the virtual machines we manage (and apparently love in IT departments) today have been done for decades on mainframe.  Most mid-size and mainframe shops have small fractions of support persons managing larger and more complex applications. Your thoughts appreciated. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "When setting up a system landscape for large and/or multiple application deployments, the consideration of mainframe should definitely be taken into account. Mainframes have been proven to be cost-effective for large-scale implementations, especially when looking at the total cost of ownership (TCO) over the long term.  Some factors to consider when evaluating mainframe for application deployments include:  1. Performance: Mainframes are known for their high performance and reliability, which can be crucial for large and critical applications.  2. Scalability: Mainframes offer scalability options that allow organizations to easily expand their system as needed without significant additional costs.  3. System management: Mainframes have sophisticated system management tools that can help streamline operations and reduce the need for manual intervention.  4. Security: Mainframes are known for their robust security features, making them a good choice for applications that handle sensitive data.  5. Total cost of ownership: When considering the overall cost of the system over its lifetime, mainframes can often be more cost-effective than a large number of scale-out VMs on Intel servers.  While some organizations may default to scale-out VMs on Intel servers due to familiarity or perceived lower upfront costs, it's important to consider the long-term implications of such decisions. Mainframes have been proven to be reliable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale deployments, and should be carefully evaluated as part of the system landscape design process.",

On that basis, I'm tempted to vote to close, but won't. As for the question (to the extent there is one), I'm going to assume that by \"mainframe\", you mean something like an IBM z series machine, rather than (for example) one of the big Fujitsu SPARC boxes. I think for many people, it's hard to recommend mainframes for a couple of reasons.   Every vendor has TCO numbers to \"prove\" their product is the best. Why should somebody trust numbers from IBM more than from Microsoft, Oracle, etc? Even if a mainframe really would make sense, such a recommendation is unlikely to be taken seriously, and whoever made such a recommendation will often be treated as a pariah. Even if the TCO would theoretically work out better in some respects, introducing machines with which existing staff are thoroughly unfamiliar would often be a mistake anyway. Using a mainframe would often lose versatility in other ways. Just for example, an Intel box can easily run Windows Terminal Server to make Word and Excel available, which is a bit tougher to do with a mainframe.  ",

        "Question": "We're developing a new project that is to be deployed on a large number of client sites. The project contains a web-based GUI as one of it's \"access points\". Speed of the web interface is a priority for this project, second only to security. In the past, we've always created \"web sites\" in Visual Studio, which, when published, results in one dll and one aspx file for each page within the system. However, I am aware that you can actually create a \"web application\" and have it compile everything down to a single dll. To me (based on no real data, just gut feeling), compiling the site as a single dll sounds like it would be better for both security and speed (if only marginally). What are the considerations we should look at, and are there any obvious pitfalls we should be aware of when choosing the method that's right for us? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "When considering whether to develop your web interface as a web site or as a web application, there are several factors to consider:  1. Performance: As you mentioned, compiling the web application down to a single dll can improve performance by reducing the number of files that need to be loaded by the server. This can result in faster load times for your application.  2. Security: While having a single dll may simplify deployment and potentially make it harder for attackers to access individual files, it is important to note that security is not solely dependent on the number of files in your application. Proper security practices, such as secure coding, data validation, and authentication, should also be implemented regardless of how your application is compiled.  3. Maintenance: Web sites allow for more flexibility in terms of making changes to individual pages without having to recompile the entire application. If frequent updates are expected, a web site may be a better option.  4. Scalability: Consider how the size and complexity of your project may affect scalability. A web application may be more suitable for larger, more complex projects with multiple developers working on the same codebase.  5. Development workflow: Consider how your team prefers to work and collaborate on the project. Web sites and web applications have different development workflows, so choose the method that aligns best with your team's preferences and processes.  In terms of pitfalls, ensure that you are familiar with the differences between web sites and web applications in terms of compilation, deployment, and configuration. Make sure that your team is comfortable with the chosen method and that you have the necessary tools and expertise to develop and maintain your application effectively.

        "Question": "I have found that there are only 3 ways to unit test (mock/stub) dependencies that are static in C#.NET:  Moles TypeMock JustMock  Given that two of these are not free and one has not hit release 1.0, mocking static stuff is not too easy. Does that make static methods and such \"evil\" (in the unit testing sense)?  And if so, why does resharper want me to make anything that can be static, static? (Assuming resharper is not also \"evil\".) Clarification: I am talking about the scenario when you want to unit test a method and that method calls a static method in a different unit/class.  By most definitions of unit testing, if you just let the method under test call the static method in the other unit/class then you are not unit testing, you are integration testing.  (Useful, but not a unit test.) ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Static methods and dependencies can make unit testing more difficult, but that doesn't necessarily make them \"evil.\" In object-oriented programming, static methods can be useful for utility functions or for methods that do not require any instance-specific data.   However, when it comes to unit testing, static methods and dependencies can make it harder to isolate and test individual units of code. This is because static methods are tightly coupled to the class they belong to, making it difficult to mock or stub them out during testing.  Resharper may suggest making things static for performance or code organization reasons, but it's important to consider the impact on unit testing. It's always a balance between writing clean, efficient code and writing code that is easily testable.  In general, it's good practice to minimize the use of static methods and dependencies in code that needs to be unit tested. This might involve refactoring code to use dependency injection or other patterns that allow for easier mocking and testing.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Looking at the other answers here, I think there might be some confusion between static methods that hold static state or cause side-effects (which sounds to me like a really bad idea), and static methods that merely return a value.   Static methods which hold no state and cause no side effects should be easily unit testable.  In fact, I consider such methods a \"poor-man's\" form of functional programming; you hand the method an object or value, and it returns an object or value.  Nothing more.  I don't see how such methods would negatively affect unit testing at all. ",

        "Question": "A well-tested codebase has a number of benefits, but testing certain aspects of the system results in a codebase that is resistant to some types of change. An example is testing for specific output--e.g., text or HTML. Tests are often (naively?) written to expect a particular block of text as output for some input parameters, or to search for specific sections in a block.  Changing the behavior of the code, to meet new requirements or because usability testing has resulted in change to the interface, requires changing the tests as well--perhaps even tests that are not specifically unit tests for the code being changed.  How do you manage the work of finding and rewriting these tests? What if you can't just \"run 'em all and let the framework sort them out\"? What other sorts of code-under-test result in habitually fragile tests?  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Managing the work of finding and rewriting tests that are dependent on specific output can be a challenging task, especially in a large and complex codebase. One approach is to continuously refactor tests as part of the development process. This means regularly reviewing and updating tests alongside code changes, so that any changes to behavior are reflected in the corresponding tests.   Another approach is to prioritize and categorize tests based on their importance and potential impact on the system. For instance, tests that are critical to the core functionality of the system should be given higher priority for review and rewriting. These tests should be thoroughly analyzed to determine the root cause of the fragility and to identify alternative strategies for testing them in a more robust manner.   If running all tests repeatedly is not feasible, due to time or resource constraints, a risk-based approach can be employed. This involves prioritizing tests based on the likelihood and impact of failure, so that tests with higher risk are given more attention during the refactoring process.   In addition to tests dependent on specific output, tests that rely on external dependencies such as databases, APIs, or third-party services are also prone to fragility. Changes in the external environment can cause these tests to fail unexpectedly, leading to false positives or negatives. To address this, mocking or stubbing techniques can be used to isolate the code-under-test from its dependencies during testing, thereby reducing the potential for fragility.   Overall, a proactive and systematic approach to managing and refactoring tests is essential for maintaining a robust and stable codebase, especially in the face of changing requirements and evolving interfaces.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I know the TDD folks will hate this answer, but a large part of it for me is to choose carefully where to test something. If I go too crazy with unit tests in the lower tiers then no meaningful change can be made without altering the unit tests.  If the interface is never exposed and not intended to be reused outside the app then this is just needless overhead to what might have been a quick change otherwise. Conversely if what you are trying to change is exposed or re-used every one of those tests you are going to have to change is evidence of something you might be breaking elsewhere. In some projects this may amount to designing your tests from the acceptance tier down rather than from the unit tests up. and having fewer unit tests and more integration style tests. It does not mean that you cannot still identify a single feature and code until that feature meets its acceptance criteria.  It simply means that in some cases you do not end up measuring the acceptance criteria with unit tests. ",

        "Question": "To the outside world, programmers, computer scientists, software engineers, and developers may all seem alike, but that's far from the case for the people who create software for a living.  Any single programmer's ability and knowledge can range very widely, as well as their tools (OS, language, and yes, preferred editor), and that diversity spawns many sub-cultures in software - like programmers who actively use Stack Overflow and this site, versus many more who don't. I'm curious to hear from others what software sub-cultures they've encountered, belonged to, admired, disliked, or even created.  For starters, I've encountered:  Microsoft-driven companies and developers: their entire stack is from Redmond, WA.  E-mail is Outlook is e-mail.  The web is IE and IIS.  They have large binders of their MS Developer Network subscription full of multiple versions of VB, .net, Visual Studio, etc.  Avoids working with a shell/command-line.  Don't see what the fuss with open-source and such is all about.  MS-centric companies tend to be 9-5 and quite corporate (driven by business managers, not software people). Nowadays (given the wide availability of non-MS tools), this is the antithesis of hacker culture. Old-school CS people: they often know Lisp and Unix extremely well; sometimes, they may have written a semi-popular Lisp themselves, or a system utility. Few, if any, \"software engineering\" things are new to them, nor are they impressed by such.  Know the references, history, and higher-level implications of programming languages like Lisp, C, Prolog, and Smalltalk.  Can be bitter about AI outcomes of the 80's and 90's. Tend to be Emacs users.  Can type out multi-line shell commands without blinking an eye.  Their advice can by cryptic, but contains gold once understood. New-school web developers: played with computers and video games growing up, but often only really started programming in the late '90s or early '00's.  Comfortable with 1 to 1.5 scripting/dynamic languages; think C and languages outside of Ruby/Perl/Python are unnecessary/magical.  May have considered HTML as programming initially.  Tend to get a Mac and be fanatical/irrational about it.  Use frameworks more than build them.  Often overly-enthusiastic about NoSQL and/or Ruby On Rails. New-school CS: lots of training in statistics, Bayesian models and inference; don't say \"AI,\" say \"machine learning.\" More Java than Lisp, but could also be expert Haskell programmers.  Seeing major real-world successes by experts in their field (Google, finance/quants) often makes them (over) confident.  But big data, and the distributed processing of such, really are changing the world.

They are often skilled in a wide range of technologies and languages, and are used to fast-paced, high-pressure environments. They may be more willing to take risks and try new approaches to problem-solving.  - DevOps practitioners: professionals who specialize in the intersection of software development and IT operations.

        "Question": "A lot of us started seeing this phenomenon with jQuery about a year ago when people started asking how to do absolutely insane things like retrieve the query string with jQuery.  The difference between the library (jQuery) and the language (JavaScript) is apparently lost on many programmers, and results in a lot of inappropriate, convoluted code being written where it is not necessary. Maybe it's just my imagination, but I swear I'm starting to see an uptick in the number of questions where people are asking to do similarly insane things with Linq, like find ranges in a sorted array.  I can't get over how thoroughly inappropriate the Linq extensions are for solving that problem, but more importantly the fact that the author just assumed that the ideal solution would involve Linq without actually thinking about it (as far as I can tell).  It seems that we are repeating history, breeding a new generation of .NET programmers who can't tell the difference between the language (C#/VB.NET) and the library (Linq). What is responsible for this phenomenon?  Is it just hype?  Magpie tendencies?  Has Linq picked up a reputation as a form of magic, where instead of actually writing code you just have to utter the right incantation?  I'm hardly satisfied with those explanations but I can't really think of anything else. More importantly, is it really a problem, and if so, what's the best way to help enlighten these people? ",

People may see others using Linq and assume it's the best or only way to solve certain problems, without fully understanding the underlying principles and capabilities of the technology.  To help enlighten these individuals, it's important to emphasize the importance of understanding the fundamentals of programming and the specific language being used. Encouraging a deeper understanding of the language and its features can help programmers make more informed decisions about when to use certain libraries or technologies.  It may also be helpful to provide guidance and resources for learning and practicing problem-solving skills. Encouraging individuals to think critically about their code and consider alternative solutions can help prevent the reliance on \"magic\" solutions like Linq. Additionally, fostering a community where individuals can ask questions and receive feedback on their code can help promote a culture of continual learning and improvement.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "It's basically because programming is fundamentally difficult.  It requires a lot of logical, structured thought in a way that a lot of people just don't know how to do.  (Or simply can't do, depending on who you listen to.) Stuff like LINQ and jQuery makes certain common data-manipulation tasks a whole lot easier.  That's great for those of us who know what we're doing, but the unfortunate side effect is that it lowers the bar. It makes it easier for people who have no idea what they're doing to start writing code and make things work.  And then when they run into reality, and find something fundamentally difficult that their simple, high-abstraction-level techniques are not well suited to, they're lost, because they don't understand the platform that their library is built upon.

        "Question": "There are some really common usability errors in everyday software we used; errors that result from the ways the particular programmer has learned without learning of all the other ways there are. For example, talking about Windows software in particular, the following common flaws come to mind:  Failure to support multiple screens. For example, windows centered in the virtual desktop (instead of a specific screen) and hence displayed spanning the monitor boundary in a dual monitor setup. Failure to support serious keyboard users. For example, utterly messed up tab order; duplicate or completely missing accelerator keys. Alt+Tab order mess-ups. For example, a window that doesn't go to the end of the tab order when minimized. Subtle breakage of common controls that were reimplemented for one reason or another. E.g. failure to implement Ctrl+Left/Right on a textbox; failure to add an Alt+Space window menu to a skinnable window, failure to make Ctrl+Insert copy to clipboard, etc, etc. This one is a huge category in its own right.  There are a gazillion of things like this. How can we ever make sure we don't break a large proportion of these? After all they aren't all written down anywhere... or are they? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One approach to prevent these common usability errors is to follow established design patterns and guidelines. By utilizing well-known design patterns, such as those outlined in the Windows User Experience Interaction Guidelines, developers can ensure that their software is consistent with industry standards and user expectations. Additionally, testing with real users can help identify potential usability issues early on in the development process. User feedback and usability testing can provide valuable insights into how users interact with the software and uncover any usability issues that may have been overlooked. By incorporating these practices into the software development process, developers can create more user-friendly and intuitive software that meets the needs and expectations of its users.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I think one thing to keep in mind is to remember the source reason for most software usability problems \u2014 usability is a human issue, and as such, is difficult to define with a set of rules.  This is totally at odds with the rules-world that most programmers want to live in. Because of that I think you need to throw out the belief that a checklist of usability problems could ever be helpful.  Believing that is thinking like a programmer and will only result in more usability problems that you simply hadn't thought of (or that are the result of sticking to a usability \"rule\" that never really should have been a rule).  One of the biggest differences can be made by designing first (read Alan Cooper's The Inmates are Running the Asylum). Second, make sure your software goes through usability testing with real users. Third, don't think like a programmer. The possible idea in your question is a perfect example of why this is important to remember.  Even good ideas (avoiding non-standard controls) are not always going to hold true.  Those controls may be faulty themselves or may be used for something they shouldn't.  The perfect solution for your form or user input may not have been invented yet, or may simply be not widely used or implemented (the iPhone is a great case study for this).  As another illustration of the problem with \"usability checklists\", the list you presented may well be common to you, and I agree they are problems, but I hadn't really thought of most of them prior to reading your list.  On the other hand, I've experienced tons of annoyances with Windows since being given a PC for my day-job:  (Windows 7) Mousing over a task bar button and then over a Window thumbnail drops all other windows to just outlines.  I've done this by accident a number of times and had what I was reading simply disappear. The Alt+tab pane can now be moused over to temporarily bring the window to the front.  However, when you let go you think it's going to stay there, and it doesn't. (MS Outlook - I know, sort of a cheap shot) If I open a new email and then close it, even if I haven't added any text it asks me if I want to save the draft.

        "Question": "I've recently been frequented by erroneous error messages from mod_security. Its filter sets cover outdated PHP exploits, and I have to rewrite my stuff because Wordpress&Co had bugs years ago.   Does this happen to anyone else?  Apache mod_security blocks possibly   dangerous HTTP requests before they   reach applications (PHP specifically).   It uses various filter sets, mostly   regex based.  So I have a nice shared hosting provider, technically apt and stuff. But this bugged me: Just last week I had to change a parameter name &src= in one of my apps because mod_security blocks ANY requests with that. I didn't look up its details, but this filter rule was preventing the exploitability of another app which I don't use and probably never had heard about. Still I had to rewrite my code (renaming parameter often suffices to trick mod_security) which had nothing to do or in common with that! And today, a silly regex blocks form submissions, because I wanted to submit php sample code. Given, this is the simple stuff that mod_security is there to protect against. But I don't believe mod_security can detect seriously obfuscated code, and just goes off at obvious (and in this case totally trivial) php snippets. Basically I'm getting penalized by mod_security because other people released bug-prone apps. (Not saying my apps are ultra secure - I'm pretty security wary, but make no hyperbolic claims.) I've already asked my provider to disable it anyway, the benefits are too minuscle IMO and for my apps.  What do you think? Does mod_security make much sense outside of WP hosting? Or is it really just a bunch of blacklists of long passed security bugs? Which of its rules are actually helpful? Is there an application level equivalent? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It sounds like you're not alone in experiencing frustrations with mod_security, as it can sometimes block legitimate requests based on outdated filter sets. It's unfortunate that you have to constantly rewrite your code to work around these issues.   In terms of whether mod_security makes sense outside of WordPress hosting, it can still be beneficial for protecting against common web application attacks, not just specific to WordPress. However, it's important to regularly update and customize the filter sets to ensure they are effective and not overly restrictive.   In terms of helpful rules, it really depends on your specific use case and the types of attacks you want to protect against. It might be worth looking into customizing the rules or working with your hosting provider to fine-tune them for your applications.   As for an application-level equivalent, there are other web application firewalls (WAFs) available that offer similar protections but may have different features and rule sets. It might be worth exploring other options if you continue to have issues with mod_security.",

I use it on some of our servers where we can't control the code that's uploaded (shared hosting servers, for example), but it's never really felt like a good solution to me. Based on it's wide and very general blacklist approach, it's more of a patch to cover up security holes than a good security policy. It can also provide a false sense of security. mod_security can reveal some common attacks but can by no means prevent any attack. Again, it's a blacklist of common known attacks. If you simply install mod_security and think that you're magically secure, you're horribly mistaken. I have found a much better policy to me managed servers where my team reviews all code that is placed on them, combined with lots of logs, logfile analysis, reporting systems, and intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IPS). Everytime third-party or open-source software is installed (I'm looking at you, WordPress!) we keep a log of where it was installed, and when new versions are released we update every copy that was installed. Again, you're more likely to find mod_security on a shared hosting server, as you're experiencing now. As you grow you can move to a VPS or clod based hosting provider where you get your own managed environment and can more tightly control the available software. ",

Here are some arguments you can use to support your proposal for a rewrite:  1. Technical Debt: The current codebase is riddled with technical debt, such as inconsistent relationships, lack of primary keys, and hard-coded pages. This makes it difficult to maintain and extend the application, resulting in wasted time and resources in the long run.  2. Business Impact: The current application may \"just work\" for now, but its inefficiencies and limitations could be holding the company back from achieving its full potential. A modern, well-designed application could improve productivity, user experience, and competitive advantage.  3. Future Scalability: The current application may not be able to support future growth and demands. A rewrite could allow for better scalability, performance, and flexibility to adapt to changing business requirements.  4. Employee Morale and Retention: Working on a legacy codebase can be frustrating and demotivating for developers. A rewrite could invigorate the team, improve morale, and attract and retain top talent.  When presenting your proposal, make sure to communicate these points clearly and concisely, with a focus on the long-term benefits for the company.

By ramp-up time, I mean the amount of time before the new developer is ready to do their first commit (on a small feature)   Fresh out of college - 1.5 months Still green, but have worked on other projects before - 1 month Mid level - 2 weeks Experienced - 1 week Senior level - 1 day  Deployment cannot be automated, because of the complexity of the existing architecture Even simple bug fixes take too long because of the complexity of existing code New features take too long, and cost too much because of the interdependence of the codebase (new features cannot be isolated, and therefore affect existing features) The formal testing cycle takes too long because of the interdependence of the existing codebase. Too many use cases are executed on too few screens. This causes training issues for the users and developers. The technology that the current system is in demands it   Quality developers with experience in the technology are too hard to find It is deprecated (It can't be upgraded to support newer platforms/features) There is simply a much more expressive higher-level technology available The cost of maintaining the infrastructure of the older technology is too high   These things are pretty self-evident. When to decide on a complete rewrite versus an incremental rebuild is more subjective, and therefore more politically charged. What I can say with conviction is that to categorically state that it is never a good idea is wrong. If a system can be incrementally redesigned, and you have the full support of project sponsorship for such a thing, then you should do it.  Here's the problem, though. Many systems cannot be incrementally redesigned. Here are some of the reasons I have encountered that prevent this (both technical and political).  Technical   The coupling of components is so high that changes to a single component cannot be isolated from other components.  A redesign of a single component results in a cascade of changes not only to adjacent components, but indirectly to all components. The technology stack is so complicated that future state design necessitates multiple infrastructure changes. This would be necessary in a complete rewrite as well, but if it's required in an incremental redesign, then you lose that advantage. Redesigning a component results in a complete rewrite of that component anyway, because the existing design is so fubar that there's nothing worth saving. Again, you lose the advantage if this is the case.  Political   The sponsors cannot be made to understand that an incremental redesign requires a long-term commitment to the project. Inevitably, most organizations lose the appetite for the continuing budget drain that an incremental redesign creates. This loss of appetite is inevitable for a rewrite as well, but the sponsors will be more inclined to continue, because they don't want to be split between a partially complete new system and a partially obsolete old system. The users of the system are too attached with their \"current screens.\" If this is the case, you won't have the license to improve a vital part of the system (the front-end). A redesign lets you circumvent this problem, since they're starting with something new. They'll still insist on getting \"the same screens,\" but you have a little more ammunition to push back.   Keep in mind that the total cost of redesiging incrementally is always higher than doing a complete rewrite, but the impact to the organization is usually smaller.  In my opinion, if you can justify a rewrite, and you have superstar developers, then do it. Only do it if you can be certain that there is the political will to see it through to completion.  This means both executive and end user buy-in.  Without it, you will fail. I'm assuming that this is why Joel says it's a bad idea.  Executive and end-user buy-in looks like a two-headed unicorn to many architects. You have to sell it aggressively, and campaign for its continuation continuously until it's complete.  That's difficult, and you're talking about staking your reputation on something that some will not want to see succeed. Some strategies for success:  If you do, however, do not try to convert existing code. Design the system from scratch. Otherwise you're wasting your time. I have never seen or heard of a \"conversion\" project that didn't end up miserably. Migrate users to the new system one team at a time. Identify the teams that have the MOST pain with the existing system, and migrate them first. Let them spread the good news by word of mouth. This way your new system will be sold from within. Design your framework as you need it. Don't start with some I-spent-6-months-building-this framework that has never seen real code. Keep your technology stack as small as possible. Don't over-design. You can add technologies as needed, but taking them out is difficult. Additionally, the more layers you have, the more work it is for developers to do things. Don't make it difficult from the get-go. Involve the users directly in the design process, but don't let them dictate how to do it. Earn their trust by showing them that you can give them what they want better if you follow good design principles.  ",

My findings:  It's fun to fight over code, but also very satisfying to collaborate on it in real time. Two people can work collaboratively or separately, and be constantly aware of each other's changes. The comments end up becoming a free-form IM conversation about the code around them. The medium is enormously less restrictive than trying to work back and forth over IM proper. It's like pair programming, but with no overhead to switch roles between driver and navigator.  Has anyone tried this before? What were some of the advantages and problems that you encountered?

        "Question": "Prevalence is a simple technique to provide ACID properties to an in-memory object model based on binary serialization and write-ahead logging.  It works like this:  Start with a snapshot.  Serialize the object model and write it to a file. Create a journal file.  For every call into the object model, serialize the call and its arguments. When the journal gets too big, you're shutting down, or it's otherwise convenient, perform a checkpoint: write a new snapshot and truncate the journal. To roll back or recover from a crash or power hit, load the last snapshot and re-execute all the calls recorded in the journal.  The precautions needed to make this work are:  Don't let mutable object references escape or enter the prevalence layer.  You need some sort of proxy or OID scheme, as if you were doing RPC.  (This is such a common newbie mistake it's been nicknamed the 'baptism problem'.) All the logic reachable from a call must be completely deterministic, and must not perform business-logic-meaningful I/O or OS calls.  Writing to a diagnostic log is probably OK, but getting the system time or launching an asynchronous delegate is generally not.  This is so that the journal replays identically even if it's restored on a different machine or at a different time.  (Most prevalence code provides an alternate time call to get the transaction timestamp.) Writer concurrency introduces ambiguity in journal interpretation, so it is prohibited.  Is it because ...  people developed a bad taste for them after trying to use one on a project that wasn't well suited* to it?   Klaus Wuestefeld's strident advocacy turned people off? people who like the imperative programming model dislike separating I/O from calculation, preferring instead to interleave computation with I/O and threading calls? prevalence layers are so conceptually simple and so intimately bound to the characteristics of the framework they inhabit that they're usually custom-rolled for the project, which makes them too alien/nonstandard/risky? it's just too hard to keep straight what you have to be careful not to do? newbies' heads just seem to explode when faced with something that isn't the same kind of two-tier database-driven app they learned to write in school? ;)   *The entire data set fits in RAM, you don't need writer concurrency, and you don't need to do ad-hoc queries, reporting, or export to a data warehouse.

It means I'm no longer working with my database (mysql) and any mysql-specific features are gone, out the window, like they don't exist. The idea the ORM has is that it's trying to help me by making everything database agnostic. This sounds great, but often there is a reason why I choose a specific database system. But by going the database agnostic route, the ORM takes the lowest common denominator, which means I end up with the smallest set of features (the ones supported by all databases).  What if I know that for the long term I won't be switching the underlying database? Why not access the database-specific features, too? ",

While ORM can provide a lot of convenience and save time in development, it does come with the trade-off of potentially sacrificing some database-specific features.  If you know for certain that you won't be switching the underlying database in the long term, you may want to consider whether the benefits of using database-specific features outweigh the convenience of ORM. In that case, you may choose to forego the ORM and work directly with your database to utilize its full capabilities.  Alternatively, some ORMs do offer the flexibility to incorporate database-specific features if needed. You may want to explore if there are any options within your chosen ORM that allow for this customization.

And can you make another demo by then? It's just never going to be an appropriate response for you to say \"dude, Mr Big is totally not buying this software, that meeting would waste my time, no, I'm not going.\" Whether Mr Big is buying or not is something the sales guy is supposed to know more about than you.

Longer term, a chat with your boss about this \"supporting the sales team\" role would probably be helpful. Is your issue the time spent? Or that you object to investing time in something that is doomed? In my experience, it is highly unusual for the number of technical people in the room to shrink as the sales process goes on - normally the tech people only show up once things are getting warm, and more of them come to each meeting until the client is landed. So you wanting to bail from the process before the sale is closed will appear strange to management and sales. Discussing this with management may help you to understand how your presence increases the chance of a sale. I think it's unlikely management will grant you a pass to bail on selected client pitches based on your opinion of whether they are going to buy or not, but you could talk about it. Finally, you clearly are expected to produce slides and demos as part of your job, so approach them with the same dignity as \"real code\". Reuse, have a repository, be modular, don't repeat yourself, figure out how to waste as little time as possible giving sales what they need.

        "ChatGpt answer": "One way to avoid anomalies like this is to ensure that your queries are atomic and consistent. In the example given, this would mean ensuring that when you query for the balance of the joint bank account, you are able to get a consistent snapshot of the data at the time of the query.  One way to achieve this is to use transactions in your queries. Transactions allow you to group multiple queries together and ensure that they are executed as a single unit of work. This can help avoid the issue of someone transferring money between accounts while you are querying the balances.  Additionally, you can also implement locking mechanisms to prevent other users from making changes to the data while you are querying it. This can help ensure that the data remains consistent and accurate throughout your query process.  Overall, the key is to ensure that your queries are designed in such a way that they account for potential changes to the data during the querying process, and to implement mechanisms such as transactions and locking to help maintain data consistency.",

        "Question": "Note: this question is an edited excerpt from a blog posting I wrote a few months ago.  After placing a link to the blog in a comment on Programmers.SE someone requested that I post a question here so that they could answer it.  This posting is my most popular, as people seem to type \"I don't get object-oriented programming\" into Google a lot.  Feel free to answer here, or in a comment at Wordpress.  What is object-oriented programming?    No one has given me a satisfactory   answer.  I feel like you will not get   a good definition from someone who   goes around saying \u201cobject\u201d and   \u201cobject-oriented\u201d with his nose in the   air. Nor will you get a good   definition from someone who has done   nothing but object-oriented   programming. No one who understands   both procedural and object-oriented   programming has ever given me a   consistent idea of what an   object-oriented program actually does.  Can someone please give me their ideas of the advantages of object-oriented programming? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects, which are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior. Objects communicate with each other by sending messages (calling methods) and can inherit attributes and behavior from parent classes.  Some of the advantages of object-oriented programming include:  1. Modularity: Objects can be easily reused in different parts of a program or in different projects, leading to increased modularity and code reusability.  2. Encapsulation: Objects encapsulate data and behavior, which helps in reducing complexity and potential errors by hiding unnecessary details from the outside world.  3. Inheritance: Objects can inherit attributes and behavior from parent classes, allowing for code reuse and the creation of hierarchies of objects with shared characteristics.  4. Polymorphism: Objects can be treated as instances of their parent class, allowing for flexibility and abstraction in programming.  Overall, object-oriented programming promotes code organization, maintainability, and scalability, making it a powerful paradigm for developing complex software systems.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "From your blog, it seems that you're familiar with both imperative and functional programming, and that you're familiar with the basic concepts involved in object-oriented programming, but you've just never really had it \"click\" as to what makes it useful.  I'll try to explain in terms of that knowledge, and hope that it's helpful to you. At its core, OOP is a way to use the imperative paradigm to better manage high degrees of complexity by creating \"smart\" data structures that model the problem domain.  In a (standard procedural non-object-oriented) program, you've got two basic things: variables, and code that knows what to do with them.  The code takes input from the user and various other sources, stores it in variables, operates on it, and produces output data which goes to the user or various other locations. Object-oriented programming is a way to simplify your program by taking that basic pattern and repeating it on a smaller scale.  Just like a program is a large collection of data with code that knows what to do with it, each object is a small piece of data bound to code that knows what to do with it. By breaking down the problem domain into smaller pieces and making sure as much data as possible is bound directly to code that knows what to do with it, you make it a lot easier to reason about the process as a whole and also about the sub-issues that make up the process. By grouping data into object classes, you can centralize code related to that data, making relevant code easier both to find and to debug.  And by encapsulating the data behind access specifiers and only accessing it through methods, (or properties, if your language supports them,) you greatly reduce the potential for data corruption or the violation of invariants. And by using inheritance and polymorphism, you can reuse preexisting classes, customizing them to fit your specific needs, without having to either modify the originals or rewrite everything from the ground up.  (Which is a thing you should never do, if you can avoid it.)  Just be careful you understand your base object, or you could end up with killer kangaroos. To me, these are the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming: complexity management, code centralization and improved problem-domain modeling through the creation of object classes, inheritance and polymorphism, and increased safety without sacrificing power or control through the use of encapsulation and properties.  I hope this helps you understand why so many programmers find it useful. EDIT: In response to Joel's question in the comments,  Can you explain what an \"object-oriented program\" contains   (other than these fancy defintions you've outlined) that is fundamentally   different from an imperative program? How do you \"get the ball rolling?\"  A little disclaimer here.  My model of \"an object-oriented program\" is basically the Delphi model, which is very similar to the C#/.NET model since they were created by former Delphi team members.  What I'm saying here may not apply, or not apply as much, in other OO languages. An object-oriented program is one in which all the logic is structured around objects.  Of course this has to be bootstrapped somewhere.  Your typical Delphi program contains initialization code that creates a singleton object called Application.  At the start of the program, it calls Application.Initialize, then a call to Application.CreateForm for every form you want to load into memory from the beginning, and then Application.Run, which displays the main form on screen and starts up the input/event loop that forms the core of any interactive computer programs. Application and your forms poll for incoming events from the OS and translate them into method calls on your object.  One thing that's very common is the use of event handlers, or \"delegates\" in .NET-speak.  An object has a method that says, \"do X and Y, but also check to see if this particular event handler is assigned, and call it if it is.\"  An event handler is a method pointer--a very simple closure that contains a reference to the method and a reference to the object instance--that's used to extend the behavior of objects.  For example, if I have a button object on my form, I customize its behavior by attaching an OnClick event handler, which causes some other object to execute a method when the button is clicked. So in an object-oriented program, most of the work gets done by defining objects with certain responsibilities and linking them together, either through method pointers or by one object directly calling a method defined in another object's public interface.  (And now we're back to encapsulation.)  This is an idea that I had no concept of back before I took OOP classes in college. ",

Our sales people often ask us something similar to the following series of questions:  How much does it cost to program a widget How many hours will it take to convert this website to this software. (Without knowing what the website currently runs) etc    How can we give a quote without any information? (No, I can't ask for more info!)  I have another question if a project goes over budget it's bad. Recently, I missed an entire menu when calculating the cost of transferring a website over to a new platform so the project went over budget. My boss was not happy at all, and it's my opinion that some things like this can't be avoided. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0\u00a0What is the general practice for dealing with going over budget    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and do projects like web development often go over budget? If you work at a web development/design/similar company: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0How does your billable hour system work? For me, we have a time tracking application that we record how many hours we spend on which project and if they are billable or internal (AKA non-billable). If don't meet xx billable hours a week we can get in trouble/fired eventually. Work you do for the company or for clients that isn't billable isn't part of this system, and we often have to do internal work, so I'm wondering if any alternative systems exist. EDIT: Ok I am a developer at this firm not a designer :) Second, I am paid salary, but here is how management looks at it. You have 35 hours a week that you must work. You could be doing work that they bill to clients in that 35 hours and you should. If they figure out a project will take 50 hours and I take 55 hours, that 5 hours could have been spent on another project that wasn't over budget so we just \"lost\" money. Another example is that if I only have 1 project, that is due in two weeks and I spend a day  doing internal work, some how we lost money because I wasn't working. If I worked that day, I would finish a day early and still have no work. Either way, the work is contract so we will get paid the same amount regardless of which days I work! ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "1. When it comes to giving a quote without much information, it can be challenging but not impossible. One approach could be to provide a rough estimate based on similar projects you've worked on in the past. You could also break down the quote into different stages or components and provide a range based on different scenarios. It's important to communicate clearly with the sales team and manage their expectations.  2. Going over budget can happen in any project, not just in web development. It's important to communicate with your team and project managers if you foresee any potential issues that could cause the project to go over budget. Transparency and communication are key in handling these situations. It's also important to learn from the mistakes and make adjustments for future projects.  3. In terms of billable hour systems, it sounds like your company has a strict system in place. Other companies may have different approaches, such as setting project-based fees, using value-based pricing, or offering retainer agreements. It's important to find a system that works best for your company and ensures that your team is properly compensated for their work.

I'm assuming you are salaried.   How can we give a quote without any information? (No, I can't ask for more info!)  Short answer? You can't, don't try. The long answer is still short.

At least to me, it would appear that topcoder.com gives a more objective evaluation of pure ability to solve problems and write code. At the same time, despite obvious technical capabilities, this person may lack any hint of social skills -- he may be purely a \"lone coder\", with little or no ability to help/work with others, may lack mentoring ability to help transfer his technical skills to others, etc. On the other hand, stackoverflow.com would at least appear to give a much better indication of peers' opinion of the coder in question, and the degree to which his presence and useful and helpful to others on the \"team\". At the same time, the scoring system is such that somebody who just throws up a lot of mediocre (or even poor answers) will almost inevitably accumulate a positive total of \"reputation\" points -- a single up-vote (perhaps just out of courtesy) will counteract the effects of no fewer than 5 down-votes, and others are discouraged (to some degree) from down-voting because they have to sacrifice their own reputation points to do so. At the same time, somebody who makes little or no technical contribution seems unlikely to accumulate a reputation that lands them (even close to) the top of the heap, so to speak. So, which provides a more useful indication of the degree to which this particular coder is likely to be useful to your organization?

On the other hand, if the organization values collaboration, communication, and the ability to work well within a team, then the top performer on stackoverflow.com may be the better fit.  In a real-world scenario, it would be ideal to have a mix of both types of coders on a team. The top performer from topcoder.com could bring technical excellence and problem-solving skills to the table, while the top performer from stackoverflow.com could bring collaboration, communication, and mentoring abilities. Ultimately, a well-rounded team with a diverse set of skills and strengths is likely to be the most successful in solving complex problems and delivering high-quality code.

        "Question": "Linguistic relativity is the idea that language shapes the way we think.  My question is, how much, and to what extent, does this apply to programming?  Are some native, natural languages better-suited for thinking about programming than others?  For instance, can the following be stated more concisely in a non-English language?  Select a pivot.  Move all the items less than the pivot to one side of the list, and all the items greater than the pivot to the other side. Does a Chinese-speaking programmer view programming in a radically different lens than an English-speaking programmer, or do the differences fade away when both are immersed in the subject? Are some programming languages and domains easier to think about in one language or another.  For instance, is it any easier to grok Ruby if you are Japanese because the creator of Ruby is Japanese?  Note that this question is not focused on \"how do programming languages affect the way people think about programming\", but rather \"how do natural languages affect the way people think about programming\". To get it out of the way, one language that clearly has a pragmatic advantage is English.  I think the advantage has little to do with programming languages choosing English keywords like if, for, while, and do, just as musicians who don't speak Italian aren't tripped up by words like forte.  It has more to do with communication of ideas with other programmers, as English is the lingua franca these days, at least in the programming world.  For instance, to ask a question in StackOverflow, you really need to know English and know it pretty well if you want good answers.  Although this sounds like an imperialist attitude, it really is true in practice. That aside, how do the intrinsic properties of languages affect how programmers who speak them think about data structures, algorithms, etc.?  Are any languages particularly concise when it comes to talking about logic and programming, allowing native speakers of those languages to think faster? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It is likely that different natural languages can influence the way programmers think about programming to some extent. For example, languages with a more structured syntax may encourage logical thinking and organization, while languages with more flexible syntax may encourage creativity and experimentation. Additionally, cultural differences in communication styles and problem-solving approaches may also play a role.  In terms of specific programming languages, it is possible that speakers of languages with certain linguistic features may find it easier to understand certain programming languages. For example, speakers of languages with a rich tradition of logic and formal reasoning may find languages like Prolog or Haskell more intuitive.  However, it is important to note that proficiency in a programming language is ultimately determined by practice, experience, and familiarity with the language itself, rather than linguistic factors alone. Ultimately, while natural language may play a role in shaping the way programmers think about programming, it is just one of many factors that contribute to a programmer's overall approach to problem-solving and coding.",

Is this a special case?  What makes it an exception? However, the first still isn't universal, because I have seen the latter style.  Besides consistency along the lines of \"there's always a space with the identifier, so we have one without\", are there any other reasons to prefer it? What about casts or array and function types?  How would you re-write these: (void*)var /*or*/ (void *)var  int[3] /*or*/ int [3] // more relevant in C++ than C: Example<int[3]>  void(int) /*or*/ void (int) // more relevant in C++ than C: std::function<void(int)>  The latter two would rarely, if ever, be used in C, but are seen with C++ templates. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "The placement of the asterisks in pointers and the style of writing it is mostly a matter of personal preference and coding style.   For function declarations like void f(int*); or void f(int *);, the former style is more common as it keeps the pointer nature of the variable with the type. However, both are valid and widely used in practice.   When dealing with casts, array types, and function types, the same principles can be applied. For example, (void*)var or (void *)var are both valid ways to cast a variable to void pointer. Similarly, int[3] or int [3] are both acceptable ways to define an array of integers with size 3.   In the context of C++, you may also come across examples like Example<int[3]> or std::function<void(int)>. In such cases, style choices may vary based on personal preference and coding standards followed by the project or team.   Overall, it is important to be consistent in your coding style choices to make the code more readable and maintainable for yourself and others working on the project.",

Another option is to look into cloud-based CI/CD services like Travis CI or CircleCI. These platforms offer flexibility and scalability for remote builds, and can easily handle multiple languages and servers. They also provide built-in integrations with popular testing frameworks, code coverage tools, and deployment environments.

Are huge (100+ line) functions still considered evil even if they're well-structured internally via the use of nested functions? Edit:  For those of you not familiar with Python or D, nested functions in these languages also allow access to the outer function scope.  In D this access allows mutation of variables in the outer scope.  In Python it only allows reading.  In D you can explicitly disable access to the outer scope in a nested function by declaring it static. ",

Huge functions can be difficult to understand and maintain, regardless of how well-structured they are internally.  While using nested functions can help in organizing and structuring the code internally, it may not completely eliminate the issues associated with large functions. It's still a good idea to break down the logic into smaller, more focused functions whenever possible.  If you find yourself writing a huge function, consider refactoring it into smaller functions that each handle a specific task or aspect of the algorithm. This not only makes the code easier to understand and work with but also allows for reusability of those smaller functions in other parts of your codebase.  In the end, the goal is to write clean, maintainable, and readable code, so if using nested functions helps achieve that, by all means, go ahead.

        "Question": " It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration  -- Edsger W. Dijkstra I have deep respect to Dijkstra but I don't agree with everything he said/wrote. I disagree specially with this quote on linked paper wrote 35 years ago about the Dartmouth BASIC implementation. Many of my coworkers or friends programmers started with BASIC, questions below have answers that indicate many programmers had their first experience on programming at BASIC. AFAIK many good programmers started at BASIC programming. I'm not talking about Visual Basic or other \"modern\" dialects of BASIC running on machines full of resources. I'm talking about old times BASIC running on \"toy\" computer, that the programmer had to worry about saving small numbers that need not be calculated as a string to save a measly byte because the computer had only a few hundreds of them, or have to use computed goto for lack of a more powerful feature, and many other things which require the programmer to think much before doing something and forcing the programmer to be creative. If you had experience with old time BASIC on a machine with limited resources (have in mind that a simple micro-controller today has much more resources than a computer in 1975, do you think that BASIC help your mind to find better solutions, to think like an engineer or BASIC drag you to dark side of programming and mutilated you mentally? Is good to learn a programming language running on a computer full of resources where the novice programmer can do all wrong and the program runs without big problems? Or is it better to learn where the programmer can't go wrong? What can you say about the BASIC have helped you to be a better/worse programmer? Would you teach old BASIC running on a 2KB (virtual) machine to a coming programmer? Sure, only exposure to BASIC is bad. Maybe you share my opinion that modern BASIC doesn't help too much because modern BASIC, as long other programming languages, gives facilities which allow the programmer doesn't think deeper. Additional information: Why BASIC? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "BASIC was one of the first widely used programming languages, especially in the early days of personal computing. It was often taught in schools and was accessible to beginners due to its simplicity. However, as Dijkstra mentioned, BASIC has limitations and bad programming habits that can hinder a programmer's development if they are not exposed to more advanced and structured languages.  Learning on a computer with limited resources and using old-time BASIC may have forced programmers to think creatively and come up with efficient solutions due to the constraints they faced. This can definitely be beneficial in developing problem-solving skills and the ability to think like an engineer.  However, it is important to move beyond BASIC and explore more advanced languages that offer better programming practices and concepts. Teaching only BASIC to novice programmers may limit their growth and hinder their ability to adapt to more complex programming tasks in the future.  In conclusion, while learning BASIC on a limited resource machine may have some benefits in terms of developing creativity and problem-solving skills, it is important to expose programmers to a variety of languages and concepts to help them become well-rounded and skilled programmers.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "The Basics popular at the time of the quote were very different from what we had even 20 years ago.  (Are you counting those among your \"modern\" dialects? ;) Forget loops, subroutines, local variables, and everything that Structured Programming (of which Dijkstra and Knuth were big proponents) emphasized.  You had GOTO, and you liked it. In this context, programmers who only knew global variables, invented their own subroutines (using more global variables for parameters and return values!), and wrote spaghetti GOTOs really were mutilated. If you're 30-something or younger today and Basic was your first language, it wasn't the same language Dijkstra was talking about.  Even if you're older and your first Basic had some of these features, as Murph comments below, it still may not have been the same language Dijkstra was talking about.  You've updated the question with context I never knew before:  Dijkstra's quote is from 1975. It wasn't until version 6 that you got separately compilable procedures \u2014 which, I believe, shows the beginning of the shift in focus away from GOTO. \"In 1976, Steve Garland added structured programming features to create Dartmouth SBASIC, a precompiler which produced version 6 output...\" [Wikipedia] The context of the quote is clearly before what we now know as control structures, and many users of the time could've been more familiar with the second-to-latest version \u2014 i.e. two versions before Garland's, which is v5 and before separately compilable procedures. GOSUB/RETURN still only handle \"simple subroutines\". \"Variable names were limited to A to Z, A0 to A9, B0 to B9, ..., Z0 to Z9, giving a maximum of 286 possible distinct variables.\" ...and they're all global.

For example, let's say we have a function that should return a certain value only if a condition is met. In this case, we may need to have multiple asserts to check both the condition and the return value of the function.

        "ChatGpt answer": "There is no one-size-fits-all answer to your question, as developers' preferences for licenses can vary based on their individual needs and beliefs about software licensing. However, there are some common considerations that developers may take into account when choosing a library or framework based on its license.  For some developers, the GPL license may be a non-starter because of its copyleft provisions, which require any derivative works to also be released under the GPL. This can be a concern for developers who want to build proprietary or closed-source software, as it potentially restricts how they can distribute their code. In this case, developers may prefer libraries or frameworks with more permissive licenses, such as the MIT license, which allows for greater flexibility in how the code can be used.  On the other hand, some developers may appreciate the principles behind the GPL license, such as promoting the open-source movement and ensuring that code remains free and accessible to all users. These developers may be willing to accept the restrictions of the GPL in exchange for the benefits it provides in terms of protecting the open-source nature of the code.  Ultimately, the choice of license for a library or framework will depend on a variety of factors, including the goals of the project, the values of the developers involved, and the intended audience for the code.

EDIT: Just to clarify, as there have been a few close votes, I'm interested in whether there are traits common to managers of developers that are not necessarily those traits that a manager of some other profession requires.  As for whether this is programming related or not, well I don't want to ask this question on a site that isn't about programming because, frankly, I'm not as interested in what people who make cans of soup for a living want from their managers as I am interested in what developers want from their managers.

        "Question": "Question first: What are some feasible alternatives to time tracking for employees in a web/software development company, and why are they better options Explanation: I work at a company where we work like this. Everybody is paid salary. We have 3 types of work, Contract, Adhoc and Internal (Non billable). Adhoc is just small changes that take a few hours and we just bill the client at the end of the month. Contracts are signed and we have this big long process, the usual. We figure out how much to charge by getting an estimation of the time involved (From the design and the developers), multiplying it by our hourly rate and that's it. So say we estimate 50 hours for a website. We have time tracking software and have to record the time in 15 we spend on it (7:00 to 7:15 for example), the project name, and give it some comments. Now if we go over the 50 hours, we are both losing money and are inefficient.  Now that I've explained how the system works, my question is how else can it be done if a better method exists (Which I'm sure one must). Nobody here likes the current system, we just can't find an alternative. I'd be more than willing to work after hours longer hours on a project to get it done in time, but I'm much inclined to do so with the current system. I'd love to be able to sum up (Or link) to this post for my manager to show them why we should use abc system instead of this system. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Some feasible alternatives to time tracking for employees in a web/software development company could include:  1. Project-based billing: Instead of tracking hours, bill clients based on the project scope and deliverables agreed upon at the beginning of the project. This can help eliminate the need for constant time tracking and focus on achieving the desired outcomes.  2. Agile methodology: Implementing agile project management practices can help break down projects into smaller tasks or sprints, allowing for more flexibility in time allocation and progress tracking. This approach encourages collaboration, adaptability, and constant communication within the team.  3. Value-based pricing: Consider charging clients based on the value delivered rather than the time spent. This approach focuses on the results achieved and allows for greater flexibility in pricing based on the client's perceived value of the project.  4. Outcome-based performance metrics: Instead of tracking time, measure employee performance based on the outcomes they produce. This can help shift the focus from hours worked to results achieved, promoting efficiency and accountability.  5. Trust and autonomy: Encourage a culture of trust and autonomy within the team, where employees are empowered to manage their own time and workload effectively. This approach can foster creativity, motivation, and a sense of ownership over projects.  Overall, these alternatives can help improve efficiency, reduce administrative burden, and promote a more collaborative and results-oriented work environment. It's important to discuss these options with your manager and colleagues to find a system that works best for your team and aligns with your company's goals and values.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Take a look at evidence based scheduling.  Can really help you see how accurate your estimates are likely to be.  Over the last year or so at Fog Creek we\u2019ve been developing a system that\u2019s so easy even our grouchiest developers are willing to go along with it. And as far as we can tell, it produces extremely reliable schedules. It\u2019s called Evidence-Based Scheduling, or EBS. You gather evidence, mostly from historical timesheet data, that you feed back into your schedules. What you get is not just one ship date: you get a confidence distribution curve, showing the probability that you will ship on any given date. It looks like this:  The steeper the curve, the more confident you are that the ship date is real. Here\u2019s how you do it...  ",

        "Question": "I'm a self-taught programmer and have just started a computer science degree to supplement my knowledge and fill in the gaps. However, I'm already debating the direction of my education. I want a 4 year bachelor's degree for sure, but after that, I'm not sure: Is it worth it to get an M.Sc? What about a Ph.D.? What opportunities do these degrees open up? Currently my goal is to be a software developer, but there are a number of fascinating fields in the software industry and I'm certainly interested in investigating many of them. It is in this respect that I think a higher degree may be worth it -- even if it wouldn't necessarily help a career of software development. So will it be worth it? Will grad school open doors? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "The decision to pursue a Master's or Ph.D. in computer science ultimately depends on your career goals and interests.   If you are primarily interested in becoming a software developer, a higher degree may not be necessary for advancing in that specific field. However, if you are interested in exploring and specializing in specific areas of computer science such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, or cybersecurity, a graduate degree can provide you with more in-depth knowledge and expertise in those fields.   A Master's degree can open up opportunities for higher-paying positions, leadership roles, and specialized job opportunities within the software industry. Additionally, it can also position you for potential management roles or teaching opportunities in academia.  On the other hand, a Ph.D. is typically pursued by those interested in conducting research, teaching at the university level, or advancing knowledge in a specific area of computer science. It can also open up opportunities to work in research labs, government agencies, or other specialized industries.  Overall, pursuing a higher degree in computer science can open doors to a wider range of career opportunities and provide you with specialized knowledge in a particular field. However, it is important to carefully consider your goals and interests before making a decision about furthering your education.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Getting a PhD does two things to you and it uses up 4 or more years. You will need to decide whether those two things are worth the time. First, it gives you some initials after your name. For the rest of time, people who see those initials will think \"wow, you must be really smart!\" (and often, they will say it out loud.) On a resume it will generally help you, though in some circumstances it might hurt you, with people thinking you're overqualified or an egghead. Second, and more importantly in my opinion, is the changes in your brain and your attitude that happen over the course of the degree. You will end up knowing more about some small part of the world than any other person. You will stand in front of 3 or 4 people who are experts, sometimes world-renowned experts, and teach them about your work. When you walk in, those experts will be supervisor, examiner, \"bosses\" of a sort and when you walk out they will be your peers. You  will learn a lot about one corner of computer science and a lot more about yourself and your capabilities. You will be confident being \"the expert\" when required. And that changes everything. Unless you know now you want to be a prof, or to join a particular research lab, it seems unusual to me that you could decide about the PhD before doing the undergrad work. Go do the undergrad, and make friends with some grad students. They will tell you all you want to know about the life of a grad student, the life of a baby prof, the job prospects when you're out, and more. I don't regret the time I spent on my PhD. It has opened many doors for me. It has made me more memorable (\"right, you're the woman with the PhD, aren't you?\") and been an asset to some of my teams independent of my abilities or knowledge (\"we have a PhD on our team!\"). But the industry I joined then is not the industry you're joining now. Talk to people who are in the thick of it now and then make a decision as you finish the undergrad work. ",
