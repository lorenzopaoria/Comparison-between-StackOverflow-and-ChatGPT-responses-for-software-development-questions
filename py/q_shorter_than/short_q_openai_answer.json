        "Question": "A coworker of mine believes that any use of in-code comments (ie, not javadoc style method or class comments) is a code smell.  What do you think? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "I think that in-code comments can be extremely helpful for providing clarity and context to the code. While it's true that overly complex or convoluted comments can be a sign of poorly written code, in-code comments can be useful for explaining the reasoning behind a particular implementation choice, documenting edge cases, or providing guidance for future modifications. In general, I believe that judicious use of in-code comments can be a positive practice in software development.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Only if the comment describes what the code is doing. If I wanted to know what was happening in a method or block, I would read the code. I would hope, anyway, that any developers working on a given project were at least familiar enough with the development language to read what is written and understand what it is doing. In some cases of extreme optimization, you might be using techniques that makes it difficult for someone to follow what your code is doing. In these cases, comments can and should be used to not only explain why you have such optimizations, but what the code is doing. A good rule of thumb would be to have someone else (or multiple other people) familiar with the implementation language and project look at your code - if they can't understand both the why and the how, then you should comment both the why and the how. However, what's not clear in the code is why you have done something. If you take an approach that might not be obvious to others, you should have a comment that explains why you made the decisions that you did. I would suspect that you might not even realize that a comment is needed until after something like a code review, where people want to know why you did X instead of Y - you can capture your answer in the code for everyone else who looks at it in the future. The most important thing, though, is to change your comments when you change your code. If you change an algorithm, be sure to update the comments with why you went with algorithm X over Y. Stale comments are an even bigger code smell. "

        "Question": "When starting a project for a company that's not primarily a programming company, one of the expectations is that there's a finished product at the end free of all bugs and does everything needed right away. However, that's rarely the case.  What are some ways to manage expectations and explain to non-programmers how software development differs from other types of product development? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "1. Educate on the complexity of software development: Explain to non-programmers that developing software is a complex process that involves writing code, testing, debugging, and iterating. Emphasize that it is not a linear process and often requires multiple iterations to get it right.  2. Emphasize the importance of testing: Make stakeholders understand the crucial role of testing in software development. Explain that testing is an ongoing process and bugs are inevitable, but they can be identified and fixed through thorough testing.  3. Communicate regularly: Keep stakeholders updated on the progress of the project and involve them in the decision-making process. Show them demos of the software in development and gather their feedback to ensure that their expectations are aligned with what is being developed.  4. Set realistic timelines: Make sure to set realistic timelines for the project and explain that delays can occur due to unforeseen issues that may arise during the development process. It is better to underpromise and overdeliver than the other way around.  5. Manage expectations: Be transparent about the limitations of the project and manage stakeholders' expectations accordingly. Communicate any potential risks or challenges that may impact the timeline or scope of the project.  6. Emphasize the iterative nature of software development: Explain to non-programmers that software development is an iterative process, where progress is made incrementally. This means that not all features will be implemented at once, but rather over multiple iterations.  By managing expectations and providing clear communication, non-programmers can better understand the challenges and nuances of software development and have a more realistic understanding of what to expect from the final product.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Pretty much everybody with a computer has encountered the concept of \"bugs\" these days, so you might start there.  \"What's the most annoying way an application has ever failed on you?  Multiply that by ten, and you'll have our users' experience if we don't devote enough resources to testing and maintenance.\" And don't underestimate the value of establishing a good working relationship with the non-programmers.  If you can establish that your judgment may be trusted, they'll take you seriously when you sound the alarm that X is going to fail spectacularly if you don't do Y pronto, even if they don't completely understand your reasoning.

        "Question": "Sometimes, the things I have to do for my job are interesting and engaging.  Sometimes, they aren't.  Occasionally, they really aren't. Do you have any particular strategies or tricks for dealing with those dull stretches when your brain would rather be doing anything other than what you're supposed to be doing, particularly when the Internet and its boundless opportunities for interesting Slack beckon? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One strategy I use when faced with a dull task is to break it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. This helps me stay focused and motivated as I work through each part. I also find that setting specific goals and deadlines for myself can help me stay on track and accountable. Additionally, I like to take short breaks when I start to feel my focus slipping, whether it's to stretch, walk around, or grab a quick snack. This can help recharge my brain and prevent burnout. Finally, I try to remind myself of the bigger picture and the importance of completing the task at hand, which can provide the motivation I need to push through the boredom.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Increments. I will pick something that I can do, even if it's a small task (i.e. modify comments in code). Pretty soon, the perfectionist in me wants to do more and more stuff and I'm back rolling. "

        "Question": "At first glance, I'd say a good programming team needs to understand the following matters:  The details of the core language / framework HTML, (asynchronous) javascript SQL / data model Usability / UI design Security Project management.  If this team is not complete: what is needed? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "If the team is not complete, you may need to consider adding the following roles:   1. Quality Assurance/Testers: Individuals who are responsible for testing the code and ensuring that it functions correctly and meets the requirements.  2. Designers: Individuals who are responsible for creating and designing the user interface and ensuring that it is user-friendly and appeals to the target audience.  3. DevOps Engineers: Individuals who are responsible for managing the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of the software application in a production environment.  4. Technical Writers: Individuals who are responsible for documenting the code, processes, and functionalities of the software application.  5. Business Analyst: Individuals who are responsible for gathering and analyzing business requirements and translating them into technical requirements for the development team.   Adding these roles to your programming team can help ensure that all aspects of the software development process are covered and that the team can deliver high-quality software products.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Customer (or an advocate of some sort).   Basically, someone that can say, \"Yes, you're building what I want and it's going to solve my problem.\" or that the team can go to when they have questions about how something is supposed to work.  That may or may not be the same person that is doing Project Management. Also, you're missing out on a QA person there.  You can't really depend on the developers to adequately test - they're usually too close to the code and the normal response for developers is to test happy path stuff, not doing weird crap like copy pasting War & Peace into a textbox and seeing what the application does.

        "Question": "Where waterfall commonly includes:  Requirements Functional design Technical design Build Test Review (Deploy)  And iterations across this list. If I forgot a step, let me know. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "You have listed the key steps in the waterfall methodology. One additional step that is sometimes included in the waterfall process is maintenance and support after the project has been deployed. This step involves ongoing monitoring, updates, and fixes to ensure that the system continues to function properly.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "It depends on many factors, including:  The domain (eg, I'd spend more time on a defense contract's requirements than I would on a Twitter clone) The developers (if they have experience building similar systems with similar technology, for example, I might spend less time on the design). The customers (How likely the requirements are to change affects how long that phase will take) The criticality of the system (I'll spend more time testing the space shuttle's launch system than I will the StackExchange rep system).  I'd give you a rough breakdown of what percent of the total effort I'd give to each section, but it'd have a margin of error +/- 10% on each based on the above factors so it'd be kinda meaningless. "
