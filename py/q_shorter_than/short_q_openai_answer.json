        "Question": "A coworker of mine believes that any use of in-code comments (ie, not javadoc style method or class comments) is a code smell.  What do you think? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "I disagree with your coworker's viewpoint. In-code comments can be extremely valuable for providing context, explanations, and solutions to complex code segments. They can help other developers (and even the original developer) understand the code more easily and prevent misunderstandings. Additionally, in-code comments can be used to document workarounds, edge cases, and potential pitfalls.  While it is important to strive for clean and readable code, comments are a helpful tool in ensuring that the codebase remains understandable and maintainable in the long run. As with any aspect of programming, the key is to use comments judiciously and thoughtfully, and not as a crutch for poorly written code.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Only if the comment describes what the code is doing. If I wanted to know what was happening in a method or block, I would read the code. I would hope, anyway, that any developers working on a given project were at least familiar enough with the development language to read what is written and understand what it is doing. In some cases of extreme optimization, you might be using techniques that makes it difficult for someone to follow what your code is doing. In these cases, comments can and should be used to not only explain why you have such optimizations, but what the code is doing. A good rule of thumb would be to have someone else (or multiple other people) familiar with the implementation language and project look at your code - if they can't understand both the why and the how, then you should comment both the why and the how. However, what's not clear in the code is why you have done something. If you take an approach that might not be obvious to others, you should have a comment that explains why you made the decisions that you did. I would suspect that you might not even realize that a comment is needed until after something like a code review, where people want to know why you did X instead of Y - you can capture your answer in the code for everyone else who looks at it in the future. The most important thing, though, is to change your comments when you change your code. If you change an algorithm, be sure to update the comments with why you went with algorithm X over Y. Stale comments are an even bigger code smell. ",

        "Question": "When starting a project for a company that's not primarily a programming company, one of the expectations is that there's a finished product at the end free of all bugs and does everything needed right away. However, that's rarely the case.  What are some ways to manage expectations and explain to non-programmers how software development differs from other types of product development? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "1. Educate them on the iterative nature of software development: Explain that software development involves constant testing, feedback, and iteration. It's a continuous process of improvement rather than a one-time task.  2. Set realistic timelines: Help non-programmers understand that developing software takes time and that unexpected issues and bugs may arise along the way. Manage their expectations by setting realistic timelines and explaining potential delays.  3. Communicate regularly: Keep non-programmers informed about the progress of the project, potential challenges, and any changes in the timeline. Regular communication can help build trust and understanding between the development team and non-programmers.  4. Emphasize the importance of testing: Explain the crucial role of testing in software development and how it helps identify and fix bugs before the product is released. Encourage non-programmers to participate in testing and provide feedback to ensure a more reliable final product.  5. Show examples and case studies: Provide examples of successful software development projects and case studies that demonstrate the complexities and challenges involved in creating high-quality software. This can help non-programmers gain a better understanding of the development process.  6. Manage scope and priorities: Help non-programmers understand the importance of prioritizing features and functionalities to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) within a set timeframe. Emphasize the need to focus on essential features first before adding more complex functionalities.  By following these strategies, you can help manage expectations and explain the differences between software development and other types of product development to non-programmers in a clear and understandable way.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Pretty much everybody with a computer has encountered the concept of \"bugs\" these days, so you might start there.  \"What's the most annoying way an application has ever failed on you?  Multiply that by ten, and you'll have our users' experience if we don't devote enough resources to testing and maintenance.\" And don't underestimate the value of establishing a good working relationship with the non-programmers.  If you can establish that your judgment may be trusted, they'll take you seriously when you sound the alarm that X is going to fail spectacularly if you don't do Y pronto, even if they don't completely understand your reasoning.

        "Question": "Sometimes, the things I have to do for my job are interesting and engaging.  Sometimes, they aren't.  Occasionally, they really aren't. Do you have any particular strategies or tricks for dealing with those dull stretches when your brain would rather be doing anything other than what you're supposed to be doing, particularly when the Internet and its boundless opportunities for interesting Slack beckon? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One strategy I find helpful is breaking up my tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. By setting small goals and giving myself specific tasks to focus on, it becomes easier to stay motivated and avoid feeling overwhelmed by the monotony.  Another helpful technique is to set a timer for a specific amount of time (such as 25 minutes) and dedicate that time solely to the task at hand. This can help create a sense of urgency and focus, as well as providing a clear endpoint to work towards.  I also find it helpful to create a pleasant work environment, whether that means listening to music or podcasts, working in a comfortable space, or incorporating small breaks or rewards throughout the day to keep myself motivated.  Lastly, I remind myself of the importance of the task at hand and the bigger picture of why it needs to be done. By focusing on the end goal and the positive impact completing the task will have, it can help me stay motivated and engaged, even during those dull stretches.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Increments. I will pick something that I can do, even if it's a small task (i.e. modify comments in code). Pretty soon, the perfectionist in me wants to do more and more stuff and I'm back rolling. ",

If this team is not complete: what is needed? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "If the programming team is not complete, some additional roles that may be needed include: - Quality assurance / testing - DevOps / infrastructure management - User experience (UX) design - Technical writing / documentation - Graphic design / branding - Business analysis / requirements gathering - Data analysis / business intelligence  It really depends on the specific needs of the project and the skills and expertise required to successfully complete it.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Customer (or an advocate of some sort).   Basically, someone that can say, \"Yes, you're building what I want and it's going to solve my problem.\" or that the team can go to when they have questions about how something is supposed to work.  That may or may not be the same person that is doing Project Management. Also, you're missing out on a QA person there.  You can't really depend on the developers to adequately test - they're usually too close to the code and the normal response for developers is to test happy path stuff, not doing weird crap like copy pasting War & Peace into a textbox and seeing what the application does.

        "ChatGpt answer": "You have outlined the general steps of a waterfall methodology but you may also consider adding the following steps:   - Documentation  - Integration  - Maintenance  - Support   These steps are necessary for a complete and successful software development process.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "It depends on many factors, including:  The domain (eg, I'd spend more time on a defense contract's requirements than I would on a Twitter clone) The developers (if they have experience building similar systems with similar technology, for example, I might spend less time on the design). The customers (How likely the requirements are to change affects how long that phase will take) The criticality of the system (I'll spend more time testing the space shuttle's launch system than I will the StackExchange rep system).  I'd give you a rough breakdown of what percent of the total effort I'd give to each section, but it'd have a margin of error +/- 10% on each based on the above factors so it'd be kinda meaningless.
