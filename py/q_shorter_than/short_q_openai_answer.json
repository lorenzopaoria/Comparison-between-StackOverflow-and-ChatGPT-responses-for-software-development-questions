        "Question": "A coworker of mine believes that any use of in-code comments (ie, not javadoc style method or class comments) is a code smell.  What do you think? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "I believe that in-code comments can be valuable when used appropriately. While it is ideal to write self-explanatory and clear code, there are cases where comments can provide additional context or explanation for more complex or tricky logic. As long as the comments are kept concise, maintain their relevance, and do not clutter the code unnecessarily, they can be a helpful tool for improving code readability and maintainability. Ultimately, it comes down to using comments judiciously and in a way that enhances, rather than detracts from, the overall code quality.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Only if the comment describes what the code is doing. If I wanted to know what was happening in a method or block, I would read the code. I would hope, anyway, that any developers working on a given project were at least familiar enough with the development language to read what is written and understand what it is doing. In some cases of extreme optimization, you might be using techniques that makes it difficult for someone to follow what your code is doing. In these cases, comments can and should be used to not only explain why you have such optimizations, but what the code is doing. A good rule of thumb would be to have someone else (or multiple other people) familiar with the implementation language and project look at your code - if they can't understand both the why and the how, then you should comment both the why and the how. However, what's not clear in the code is why you have done something. If you take an approach that might not be obvious to others, you should have a comment that explains why you made the decisions that you did. I would suspect that you might not even realize that a comment is needed until after something like a code review, where people want to know why you did X instead of Y - you can capture your answer in the code for everyone else who looks at it in the future. The most important thing, though, is to change your comments when you change your code. If you change an algorithm, be sure to update the comments with why you went with algorithm X over Y. Stale comments are an even bigger code smell. ",

        "Question": "When starting a project for a company that's not primarily a programming company, one of the expectations is that there's a finished product at the end free of all bugs and does everything needed right away. However, that's rarely the case.  What are some ways to manage expectations and explain to non-programmers how software development differs from other types of product development? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "1. Communication: It's important to communicate with non-programmers in a clear and understandable way about the intricacies of software development. Regular status updates and progress reports can help manage expectations and keep everyone informed about the project's progress.  2. Education: Help non-programmers understand that software development is an iterative process and bugs are a natural part of the development cycle. Explain that fixing bugs and addressing user feedback is necessary to create a high-quality product.  3. Setting realistic timelines: Be transparent about the time and resources required for software development. Help non-programmers understand that building complex software takes time and that rushing the process can result in a subpar product.  4. Prioritizing features: Work with non-programmers to prioritize features and functionalities based on their importance and impact on the end-user. Help them understand that not all features can be included in the initial release and that prioritizing certain features can help create a more focused and successful product.  5. User testing and feedback: Encourage non-programmers to participate in user testing and provide feedback on the product. This can help them understand the importance of continuously improving and refining the software based on user needs and preferences.  6. Managing expectations: Be honest about the limitations and challenges of software development. Help non-programmers understand that perfection is not always achievable, and that software development is an ongoing process of improvement and refinement.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Pretty much everybody with a computer has encountered the concept of \"bugs\" these days, so you might start there.  \"What's the most annoying way an application has ever failed on you?  Multiply that by ten, and you'll have our users' experience if we don't devote enough resources to testing and maintenance.\" And don't underestimate the value of establishing a good working relationship with the non-programmers.  If you can establish that your judgment may be trusted, they'll take you seriously when you sound the alarm that X is going to fail spectacularly if you don't do Y pronto, even if they don't completely understand your reasoning.

        "Question": "Sometimes, the things I have to do for my job are interesting and engaging.  Sometimes, they aren't.  Occasionally, they really aren't. Do you have any particular strategies or tricks for dealing with those dull stretches when your brain would rather be doing anything other than what you're supposed to be doing, particularly when the Internet and its boundless opportunities for interesting Slack beckon? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One strategy that can be helpful is breaking up the tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. By setting mini-goals for yourself and rewarding yourself with a quick break or a few minutes of browsing the internet after accomplishing each chunk, you can make the task more bearable.  Another strategy is to find ways to make the task more engaging or challenging. This could involve trying to look at the task from a different perspective, finding a new approach to completing it, or setting personal challenges or goals related to the task.  Additionally, finding ways to make the task more enjoyable, such as listening to music or a podcast while working, changing up your work environment, or collaborating with a colleague can help make the dull stretches more bearable.  Lastly, if all else fails, sometimes a quick break to recharge and refresh your mind can make a world of difference. Taking a short walk, grabbing a snack, or doing a quick breathing exercise can help you refocus and tackle the task with renewed energy and motivation.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Increments. I will pick something that I can do, even if it's a small task (i.e. modify comments in code). Pretty soon, the perfectionist in me wants to do more and more stuff and I'm back rolling. ",

If this team is not complete: what is needed? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "If the team is not complete, they may need additional expertise in areas such as:   - Backend development (server-side scripting, database management) - Frontend development (CSS styling, responsive design) - DevOps (deployment, cloud computing, automating deployment) - Quality Assurance (testing, debugging, ensuring code quality) - User experience design (creating user-friendly interfaces, conducting user research) - Data analysis (working with big data, data visualization) - Artificial intelligence and machine learning (implementing advanced algorithms, working with AI tools) - Mobile app development (creating apps for iOS, Android, etc.) - Networking and security (ensuring secure data transmission, preventing cyber attacks)",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Customer (or an advocate of some sort).   Basically, someone that can say, \"Yes, you're building what I want and it's going to solve my problem.\" or that the team can go to when they have questions about how something is supposed to work.  That may or may not be the same person that is doing Project Management. Also, you're missing out on a QA person there.  You can't really depend on the developers to adequately test - they're usually too close to the code and the normal response for developers is to test happy path stuff, not doing weird crap like copy pasting War & Peace into a textbox and seeing what the application does.

        "Question": "Where waterfall commonly includes:  Requirements Functional design Technical design Build Test Review (Deploy)  And iterations across this list. If I forgot a step, let me know. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It seems like you have captured the main steps of the waterfall development process. One additional step that is often included in waterfall methodology is Maintenance, which involves ongoing support and updates after the software has been deployed. This step may involve bug fixes, enhancements, and other maintenance activities to ensure the software continues to meet user needs.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "It depends on many factors, including:  The domain (eg, I'd spend more time on a defense contract's requirements than I would on a Twitter clone) The developers (if they have experience building similar systems with similar technology, for example, I might spend less time on the design). The customers (How likely the requirements are to change affects how long that phase will take) The criticality of the system (I'll spend more time testing the space shuttle's launch system than I will the StackExchange rep system).  I'd give you a rough breakdown of what percent of the total effort I'd give to each section, but it'd have a margin of error +/- 10% on each based on the above factors so it'd be kinda meaningless.
