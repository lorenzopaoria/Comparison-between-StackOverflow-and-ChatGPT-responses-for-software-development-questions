        "Question": "A coworker of mine believes that any use of in-code comments (ie, not javadoc style method or class comments) is a code smell.  What do you think? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "I believe that in-code comments can be helpful in certain situations. While it is true that well-written code should be self-explanatory and easy to understand without the need for excessive comments, there are times when an explanation or clarification within the code itself can be beneficial.  In-code comments can help in situations where the code is complex, or when a certain workaround or hack is necessary for a temporary fix. They can also be useful when making changes to existing code, as they can provide context and reasoning for why certain decisions were made.  That being said, it is important to use comments judiciously and not rely on them as a crutch for poor coding practices. Code should always be written as clearly and concisely as possible, with comments used only as a supplement when necessary.  In essence, while in-code comments should not be seen as a code smell per se, overuse or reliance on them may indicate underlying issues with the code itself that should be addressed.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Only if the comment describes what the code is doing. If I wanted to know what was happening in a method or block, I would read the code. I would hope, anyway, that any developers working on a given project were at least familiar enough with the development language to read what is written and understand what it is doing. In some cases of extreme optimization, you might be using techniques that makes it difficult for someone to follow what your code is doing. In these cases, comments can and should be used to not only explain why you have such optimizations, but what the code is doing. A good rule of thumb would be to have someone else (or multiple other people) familiar with the implementation language and project look at your code - if they can't understand both the why and the how, then you should comment both the why and the how. However, what's not clear in the code is why you have done something. If you take an approach that might not be obvious to others, you should have a comment that explains why you made the decisions that you did. I would suspect that you might not even realize that a comment is needed until after something like a code review, where people want to know why you did X instead of Y - you can capture your answer in the code for everyone else who looks at it in the future. The most important thing, though, is to change your comments when you change your code. If you change an algorithm, be sure to update the comments with why you went with algorithm X over Y. Stale comments are an even bigger code smell. ",

        "Question": "When starting a project for a company that's not primarily a programming company, one of the expectations is that there's a finished product at the end free of all bugs and does everything needed right away. However, that's rarely the case.  What are some ways to manage expectations and explain to non-programmers how software development differs from other types of product development? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "1. Educate the stakeholders: Take the time to educate non-programmers on the iterative process of software development and how it differs from traditional product development. Explain that software development often involves multiple stages of testing, feedback, and revisions before reaching a final product.  2. Set clear expectations: Communicate with stakeholders early on about the potential for bugs and unexpected challenges during the development process. Establish realistic timelines and deliverables to manage expectations about the final product.  3. Show progress regularly: Involve stakeholders in the development process by providing regular updates and demonstrations of the software in progress. This can help them understand the complexity of the project and the steps involved in creating a successful product.  4. Involve stakeholders in decision-making: Encourage stakeholders to participate in key decisions throughout the development process, such as prioritizing features and providing feedback on design. This can help them feel more invested in the project and understand the trade-offs involved in software development.  5. Provide ongoing support: After the initial product is delivered, continue to provide support and maintenance to address any bugs or issues that may arise. This can help demonstrate the ongoing nature of software development and the importance of continuous improvement.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Pretty much everybody with a computer has encountered the concept of \"bugs\" these days, so you might start there.  \"What's the most annoying way an application has ever failed on you?  Multiply that by ten, and you'll have our users' experience if we don't devote enough resources to testing and maintenance.\" And don't underestimate the value of establishing a good working relationship with the non-programmers.  If you can establish that your judgment may be trusted, they'll take you seriously when you sound the alarm that X is going to fail spectacularly if you don't do Y pronto, even if they don't completely understand your reasoning.

        "Question": "Sometimes, the things I have to do for my job are interesting and engaging.  Sometimes, they aren't.  Occasionally, they really aren't. Do you have any particular strategies or tricks for dealing with those dull stretches when your brain would rather be doing anything other than what you're supposed to be doing, particularly when the Internet and its boundless opportunities for interesting Slack beckon? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One strategy that I find effective is breaking my tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. This way, I can focus on completing one small task at a time, which can be less overwhelming and more motivating. Another strategy is setting specific goals and deadlines for myself, creating a sense of urgency and structure to keep me on track.   I also find it helpful to take short breaks and reward myself after completing a particularly dull task. This could be anything from a quick walk outside to grabbing a coffee or even just a few minutes of browsing the internet as a reward.   Lastly, I try to eliminate distractions as much as possible by shutting off notifications, closing unnecessary tabs, and setting dedicated work times. This helps me stay focused and productive during those dull stretches.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Increments. I will pick something that I can do, even if it's a small task (i.e. modify comments in code). Pretty soon, the perfectionist in me wants to do more and more stuff and I'm back rolling. ",

If this team is not complete: what is needed? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "If the programming team is not complete, some additional roles that may be needed include:  1. Graphic designer: to create visually appealing UI designs and graphics 2. Quality assurance engineer: to test the software for bugs and ensure it meets quality standards 3. System administrator: to manage server infrastructure and ensure optimal performance and uptime 4. Data analyst: to analyze and interpret data collected by the software for insights and decision-making 5. Technical writer: to document the software and its features for end users and developers 6. User experience designer: to focus on the overall experience of using the software and ensure it is user-friendly.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Customer (or an advocate of some sort).   Basically, someone that can say, \"Yes, you're building what I want and it's going to solve my problem.\" or that the team can go to when they have questions about how something is supposed to work.  That may or may not be the same person that is doing Project Management. Also, you're missing out on a QA person there.  You can't really depend on the developers to adequately test - they're usually too close to the code and the normal response for developers is to test happy path stuff, not doing weird crap like copy pasting War & Peace into a textbox and seeing what the application does.

        "Question": "Where waterfall commonly includes:  Requirements Functional design Technical design Build Test Review (Deploy)  And iterations across this list. If I forgot a step, let me know. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "You seem to have included all the necessary steps in the waterfall model of software development. The iterative process involves going back to the previous steps to make necessary changes or adjustments before moving forward. However, it's important to note that the waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach, so it's not typically associated with iterations across the list of steps. Each phase is completed before moving on to the next phase in a waterfall model.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "It depends on many factors, including:  The domain (eg, I'd spend more time on a defense contract's requirements than I would on a Twitter clone) The developers (if they have experience building similar systems with similar technology, for example, I might spend less time on the design). The customers (How likely the requirements are to change affects how long that phase will take) The criticality of the system (I'll spend more time testing the space shuttle's launch system than I will the StackExchange rep system).  I'd give you a rough breakdown of what percent of the total effort I'd give to each section, but it'd have a margin of error +/- 10% on each based on the above factors so it'd be kinda meaningless.
