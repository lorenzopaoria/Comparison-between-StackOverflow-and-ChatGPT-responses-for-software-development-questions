        "Question": "A coworker of mine believes that any use of in-code comments (ie, not javadoc style method or class comments) is a code smell.  What do you think? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "I think that in-code comments can be useful in certain situations, such as explaining complex pieces of logic or providing context for future maintainers of the code. While it is ideal to write clear and self-explanatory code, there may be times when a comment can provide additional clarity or insights that may not be immediately obvious from the code itself. However, it is important to not rely too heavily on comments to explain poorly written or convoluted code, as this can lead to maintenance issues in the future. Overall, in-code comments can be a helpful tool when used judiciously and in conjunction with well-structured and easily understandable code.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Only if the comment describes what the code is doing. If I wanted to know what was happening in a method or block, I would read the code. I would hope, anyway, that any developers working on a given project were at least familiar enough with the development language to read what is written and understand what it is doing. In some cases of extreme optimization, you might be using techniques that makes it difficult for someone to follow what your code is doing. In these cases, comments can and should be used to not only explain why you have such optimizations, but what the code is doing. A good rule of thumb would be to have someone else (or multiple other people) familiar with the implementation language and project look at your code - if they can't understand both the why and the how, then you should comment both the why and the how. However, what's not clear in the code is why you have done something. If you take an approach that might not be obvious to others, you should have a comment that explains why you made the decisions that you did. I would suspect that you might not even realize that a comment is needed until after something like a code review, where people want to know why you did X instead of Y - you can capture your answer in the code for everyone else who looks at it in the future. The most important thing, though, is to change your comments when you change your code. If you change an algorithm, be sure to update the comments with why you went with algorithm X over Y. Stale comments are an even bigger code smell. ",

        "Question": "When starting a project for a company that's not primarily a programming company, one of the expectations is that there's a finished product at the end free of all bugs and does everything needed right away. However, that's rarely the case.  What are some ways to manage expectations and explain to non-programmers how software development differs from other types of product development? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "1. Educate non-programmers on the iterative nature of software development: Explain that software development is an ongoing process that involves constant feedback, testing, and refinement. It's not a linear process like traditional product development.  2. Set realistic expectations: Emphasize that it's normal to encounter bugs and issues during the development process, and that these are a natural part of software development. Let stakeholders know that it's better to catch and address these issues early on rather than rushing to release a potentially faulty product.  3. Communicate regularly and openly: Keep stakeholders informed about the progress of the project, including any challenges or setbacks. By maintaining open lines of communication, you can manage expectations and address any concerns before they become bigger issues.  4. Encourage stakeholder involvement: Involve stakeholders in the development process by soliciting feedback, conducting user testing, and seeking input on design decisions. This helps to ensure that the final product meets their needs and expectations.  5. Emphasize the importance of testing and quality assurance: Explain that thorough testing and quality assurance processes are essential for ensuring the reliability and functionality of the software. Encourage stakeholders to be patient and allow time for these processes to be completed.  6. Provide training and support: Once the software is complete, offer training and support to help users become familiar with the new product. This can help alleviate any concerns or frustrations that may arise during the initial implementation phase.  Overall, it's important to approach software development as a collaborative process and to involve stakeholders in the project from start to finish. By managing expectations and educating non-programmers on the unique challenges and benefits of software development, you can help ensure a successful outcome for the project.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Pretty much everybody with a computer has encountered the concept of \"bugs\" these days, so you might start there.  \"What's the most annoying way an application has ever failed on you?  Multiply that by ten, and you'll have our users' experience if we don't devote enough resources to testing and maintenance.\" And don't underestimate the value of establishing a good working relationship with the non-programmers.  If you can establish that your judgment may be trusted, they'll take you seriously when you sound the alarm that X is going to fail spectacularly if you don't do Y pronto, even if they don't completely understand your reasoning.

        "Question": "Sometimes, the things I have to do for my job are interesting and engaging.  Sometimes, they aren't.  Occasionally, they really aren't. Do you have any particular strategies or tricks for dealing with those dull stretches when your brain would rather be doing anything other than what you're supposed to be doing, particularly when the Internet and its boundless opportunities for interesting Slack beckon? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One strategy that I find helpful in these situations is setting small goals for myself. Breaking down a boring task into smaller, more manageable tasks can make the overall process feel less daunting. By setting achievable goals, I can maintain a sense of progress and accomplishment even during those dull stretches.  Another trick I like to use is incorporating small rewards for myself. For example, I might allow myself a short break to browse the internet or check social media after completing a certain portion of the task. This helps to keep me motivated and focused, knowing that there is a reward waiting for me once I finish what I need to do.  Additionally, I find that listening to music or podcasts can help me stay engaged and make the task feel more enjoyable. Finding something to listen to that interests me can help pass the time and make the task more bearable.  Overall, the key is to find techniques that work for you to keep yourself motivated and on track during those dull stretches. By incorporating small goals, rewards, and engaging activities, you can make even the most boring tasks more manageable.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Increments. I will pick something that I can do, even if it's a small task (i.e. modify comments in code). Pretty soon, the perfectionist in me wants to do more and more stuff and I'm back rolling. ",

If this team is not complete: what is needed? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "If the programming team is not complete, they may benefit from adding additional members with expertise in areas such as testing and quality assurance, version control, performance optimization, DevOps, front-end development, back-end development, mobile development, or specialized domain knowledge related to the project. Additionally, having individuals with strong communication and collaboration skills will also be essential to ensure a successful team dynamic.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Customer (or an advocate of some sort).   Basically, someone that can say, \"Yes, you're building what I want and it's going to solve my problem.\" or that the team can go to when they have questions about how something is supposed to work.  That may or may not be the same person that is doing Project Management. Also, you're missing out on a QA person there.  You can't really depend on the developers to adequately test - they're usually too close to the code and the normal response for developers is to test happy path stuff, not doing weird crap like copy pasting War & Peace into a textbox and seeing what the application does.

        "Question": "Where waterfall commonly includes:  Requirements Functional design Technical design Build Test Review (Deploy)  And iterations across this list. If I forgot a step, let me know. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "The waterfall model typically includes the following steps:  1. Requirements analysis 2. System design 3. Implementation 4. Testing 5. Deployment  Iterations can occur within each phase, but the basic idea is that each phase is completed before moving on to the next. If there are any additional steps or if any steps were missed, please let me know.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "It depends on many factors, including:  The domain (eg, I'd spend more time on a defense contract's requirements than I would on a Twitter clone) The developers (if they have experience building similar systems with similar technology, for example, I might spend less time on the design). The customers (How likely the requirements are to change affects how long that phase will take) The criticality of the system (I'll spend more time testing the space shuttle's launch system than I will the StackExchange rep system).  I'd give you a rough breakdown of what percent of the total effort I'd give to each section, but it'd have a margin of error +/- 10% on each based on the above factors so it'd be kinda meaningless.
