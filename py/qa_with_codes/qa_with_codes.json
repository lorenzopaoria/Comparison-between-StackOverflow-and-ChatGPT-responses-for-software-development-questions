        "Question": "I have read a few articles on Internet about programming language choice in the enterprise. Recently many dynamic typed languages have been popular, i.e. Ruby, Python, PHP and Erlang. But many enterprises still stay with static typed languages like C, C++, C# and Java. And yes, one of the benefits of static typed languages is that programming errors are caught earlier, at compile time, rather than at run time. But there are also advantages with dynamic typed languages. (more on Wikipedia) The main reason why enterprises don't start to use languages like Erlang, Ruby and Python, seem to be the fact that they are dynamic typed. That also seem to be the main reason why people on StackOverflow decide against Erlang. See Why did you decide \"against\" Erlang. However, there seem to be a strong criticism against dynamic typing in the enterprises, but I don't really get it why it is that strong. Really, why is there so much criticism against dynamic typing in the enterprises? Does it really affect the cost of projects that much, or what? But maybe I'm wrong. ",
        "Best answer": "Yes, I believe that they do. There are a few reasons that need to be considered in the selection of a language for a new project:  Run-time speed. Compared to C/C++/Fortran, Perl and Python are so slow it's funny. Initialization speed. Compared to the above fast languages, Java falls over and cries as the JVM keeps loading and loading and...while(1).... Prototype-ability. Exhaustively going through and doing the declaration/definition work required for C++ or Java increases the LOC, which is the only known metric that reliably correlates with bugcounts. It also takes a lot of time. It also requires a bit more thinking about types and connections. Internal fiddlability. Dynamically messing around with your internals is great until you begin to debug your self-modifying code. (Python, Lisp, Perl) Correctness verification. A compiler can provide a quick once-over pass of semi-correctness of your code in C++, and this can be really nice.  Static analysis details. C and Java have pretty good static analysis. Perl is not completely statically analyzable at a theoretical level (Possibly Python too). I'm reasonably sure Lisp isn't either.  Weird platforms only take C, in general.  Support chain. If you can have a contract that you will get your bugs looked at and worked on, that's huge.   If you can presume that the organization you are working with has a principle of \"Going forward\"(There's an accounting term for this), and won't just randomly decide to not work on the software, then you have a much better case for using the software. Since there's no Major Business selling (carrying implication of taking responsibility of maintaining it) Python/Perl/$dynamic_language, it considerably reduces risk.  In my experience, open source maintainers often have an issue with fully taking responsibility for bugfixes and releasing updates. \"It's free, YOU work on it!\" is not an answer that is acceptable to most businesses (not their core compentencies, among other things).  Of course, I'm not talking about the webapp/startup world, which tends to play by high risk/high reward rules and be very open to staying on the frothing edge of tech. "

        "Question": "goto is almost universally discouraged. Is using this statement ever worthwhile? ",
        "Best answer": "This has been discussed several times on Stack Overflow, and Chris Gillum summarized the possible uses of goto:  Cleanly exiting a function Often in a function, you may allocate resources and need to exit in multiple places.  Programmers can simplify their code by putting the resource cleanup code at the end of the function all all \"exit points\" of the function would goto the cleanup label.  This way, you don't have to write cleanup code at every \"exit point\" of the function. Exiting nested loops If you're in a nested loop and need to break out of all loops, a goto can make this much cleaner and simpler than break statements and if-checks. Low-level performance improvements This is only valid in perf-critical code, but goto statements execute very quickly and can give you a boost when moving through a function.  This is a double-edged sword, however, because a compiler typically cannot optimize code that contains gotos.  I'd argue, as many others would argue, that in all of these cases, the usage of goto is used as a means to get out of a corner one coded oneself into, and is generally a symptom of code that could be refactored.

        "Question": "I know that they are implemented extremely unsafely in C/C++. Can't they be implemented in a safer way? Are the disadvantages of macros really bad enough to outweigh the massive power they provide? ",
        "Best answer": "I think the main reason is that macros are lexical. This has several consequences:  The compiler has no way of checking that a macro is semantically closed, i.e. that it represents a “unit of meaning” like a function does. (Consider #define TWO 1+1 — what does TWO*TWO equal? 3.) Macros are not typed like functions are. The compiler cannot check that the parameters and return type make sense. It can only check the expanded expression that uses the macro. If the code doesn’t compile, the compiler has no way of knowing whether the error is in the macro itself or the place where the macro is used. The compiler will either report the wrong place half of the time, or it has to report both even though one of them is probably fine. (Consider #define min(x,y) (((x)<(y))?(x):(y)): What should the compiler do if the types of x and y don’t match or don’t implement operator<?) Automated tools cannot work with them in semantically useful ways. In particular, you can’t have things like IntelliSense for macros that work like functions but expand to an expression. (Again, the min example.) The side-effects of a macro are not as explicit as they are with functions, causing potential confusion for the programmer. (Consider again the min example: in a function call, you know that the expression for x is evaluated only once, but here you can’t know without looking at the macro.)  Like I said, these are all consequences of the fact that macros are lexical. When you try to turn them into something more proper, you end up with functions and constants. "

        "Question": "Language shortcuts can often be used to make code more concise. For example, ternary and null coalescing operators can reduce the amount of code, but arguably to the detriment of readability: In C#: Person newGuy = new Person(); if (boss == null) {     newGuy.Boss = GetDefaultBoss(); } else {     newGuy.Boss = boss; }  is functionally equivalent to: Person newGuy = new Person(); newGuy.Boss = boss ?? GetDefaultBoss();  but obviously a lot more verbose. Where do you draw the line when it comes to conciseness vs readability? ",
        "Best answer": "Both. Your first example is certainly more verbose, and arguably more explicit... but it also requires me to scan five lines instead of one. Worse, it deemphasizes its purpose - assigning a value to newGuy.Boss. Your second example may cost me a second if I'm unfamiliar with the null coalescing operator, but there can be no doubt as to its purpose, and if I'm scanning through a larger routine looking for the source of a value, it will be much easier for me to pick this one out. Now, contrast this: if (boss == null) {     newGuy.Boss = GetDefaultBoss();     newGuy.IsTemp = true;     newGuy.AddTask(\"orientation\"); } else {     newGuy.Boss = boss;     newGuy.IsTemp = false; }  ...with: newGuy.Boss = boss ?? GetDefaultBoss(); newGuy.IsTemp = boss == null; if ( boss == null ) newGuy.AddTask(\"orientation\");  The latter example is again much shorter, but now it obscures its purpose by making tasks triggered by the same test appear to be distinct.

When your input validation is essentially \"make sure the user knows what format this field should be in and trust what they've entered is right\", then unexpected things are bound to find their way in to the app. Aside from the obvious security implications, users make mistakes.

The EICAR test file was used to functionally test an antivirus system.  As it stands today almost every AV system will flag EICAR as being a \"test\" virus.  For more information on this historic test virus please click here. Currently the EICAR test file is only good for testing the presence of an AV solution, but it doesn't check for engine file or DAT file up-to-dateness. In other words, why do a functional test of a system that could have definition files that are more than 10 years old.  With the increase of zero day threats it doesn't make much sense to functionally test your system using EICAR. That being said, I think EICAR needs to be updated/modified to be effective test that works in conjunction with an AV management solution. This question is about real world testing, without using live viruses... which is the intent of the original EICAR. That being said I'm proposing a new EICAR file format with the appendage of an XML blob that will conditionally cause the Antivirus engine to respond.

Also there is a passcode that will protect the usage of EICAR to the system administrator.

While it does help to know how arrays work in C if you're planning on doing complicated things with them, it is unproductive to always have to think \"I need to store the two bits of memory 2*i bytes to the right of the memory location referenced by a.\"  The whole point of an array is the ability to abstract away the process of storing a sequence as a coherent unit.  The [] notation facilitates this abstraction.  It's not syntactic sugar. This is not to imply that syntactic sugar is always bad thing.  Like many alliterations, it has become an epithet and pitted against \"real features.\"  But LISP and Scheme, for example, would be unreadable if not for the let shorthand (and others). The ternary operator, <pred> ? <cnsq> : <alt>, is another example.  Syntactic sugar can help to organize programs and remove redundant code, which may save in maintenance down the line.  Syntactic sugar may sometimes be preferable to piling on \"real features\" if it helps to remove syntactic barriers to programming. To quote R^5RS, \"Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary.\"  IMHO, syntax can qualify as a weakness and restriction and so letting programmers get away from syntax can increase a language's expressivity.

        "Question": "In Windows the default way is registry. This allow you to differentiate system-wide and per-user settings. In Unix you should use text files in the /etc folder for system-wide settings (what's the convention for per-user settings?). Many new programs (and especially those designed for being portable) use XML files.  What's the best way (and location) to store non-BLOB settings? Should we follow each system default or have a unified solution? And what's the best portable way?  ",
        "Best answer": " What's the best way (and location) to store non-BLOB settings?  On Windows, it seems acceptable to use the registry. In my opinion, the registry was a poorly-devised system, and instead a simple text file in the Users\\Username\\AppData directory should be preferred. This is easier to back up, less dangerous for users to modify, and easier to clean up. On Linux and most Unixes, The preferred location is /home/user/.config/appname for user-specific settings and /etc/ for global (system-wide) settings. The less-preferred (but acceptable) location for user settings is ~/.appname, but this is generally falling out of favor. These files should be user-editable, so a human-readable format is always preferred. I disagree with most people that XML is an acceptable format for storing non-blob data. It is, in my opinion, an overwrought and excessively complex format for what usually ends up being very small pieces of structured data. I prefer to see files in YAML, JSON, ASN.1, name=value pairs, or similar formats. Having too much syntax makes it too easy for a user to mess up and leave the file in an invalid format.  Should we follow each system default or have a unified solution?  That is entirely up to you, but keep some things in mind:  Platforms like *nix have strict limitations on which locations are writable. More strict than Windows. So:  The only place you should write to anything is in the user's home directory. Unless your application is a system service; in which case, all mutable data files should be written in /var/. Nonmutable data files should be kept in your app directory in /usr/share/ or /usr/local/share/ or /opt/ Configuration files in /etc/ should never be written to by the application when it is running, even if it has write access to them. /etc/ should be the repository for default behaviors and nothing else. Plan for your application to be installed in one of three places: /usr/local/, /opt/appname, or /home/username/appname. Blobs should be stored alongside other configuration files if they are to be changed. It is generally preferable to use a user-editable format, so something like SQLite or Berkeley DB is preferred (since there are command-line tools for each), but not required.  On Windows, your applications should only ever write in the User directory. The standardized location for data files is Users\\User\\AppData. Nowhere else seems acceptable. On Mac OS X, your application settings should be stored in ~/Library/Preferences along with all of the other applications' plist files. plist seems to be the preferred format, but you'll want to double-check with the Apple guidelines.   And what's the best portable way?  There is no \"best,\" to be honest. There are only platform-specific limitations and expectations. My recommendation is to stick with platform-specific means, even if it means writing more code. "

Its filter sets cover outdated PHP exploits, and I have to rewrite my stuff because Wordpress&Co had bugs years ago.   Does this happen to anyone else?  Apache mod_security blocks possibly   dangerous HTTP requests before they   reach applications (PHP specifically).   It uses various filter sets, mostly   regex based.  So I have a nice shared hosting provider, technically apt and stuff. But this bugged me: Just last week I had to change a parameter name &src= in one of my apps because mod_security blocks ANY requests with that. I didn't look up its details, but this filter rule was preventing the exploitability of another app which I don't use and probably never had heard about. Still I had to rewrite my code (renaming parameter often suffices to trick mod_security) which had nothing to do or in common with that! And today, a silly regex blocks form submissions, because I wanted to submit php sample code. Given, this is the simple stuff that mod_security is there to protect against. But I don't believe mod_security can detect seriously obfuscated code, and just goes off at obvious (and in this case totally trivial) php snippets. Basically I'm getting penalized by mod_security because other people released bug-prone apps. (Not saying my apps are ultra secure - I'm pretty security wary, but make no hyperbolic claims.) I've already asked my provider to disable it anyway, the benefits are too minuscle IMO and for my apps.  What do you think? Does mod_security make much sense outside of WP hosting? Or is it really just a bunch of blacklists of long passed security bugs? Which of its rules are actually helpful? Is there an application level equivalent? ",

I use it on some of our servers where we can't control the code that's uploaded (shared hosting servers, for example), but it's never really felt like a good solution to me. Based on it's wide and very general blacklist approach, it's more of a patch to cover up security holes than a good security policy. It can also provide a false sense of security. mod_security can reveal some common attacks but can by no means prevent any attack. Again, it's a blacklist of common known attacks. If you simply install mod_security and think that you're magically secure, you're horribly mistaken. I have found a much better policy to me managed servers where my team reviews all code that is placed on them, combined with lots of logs, logfile analysis, reporting systems, and intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IPS). Everytime third-party or open-source software is installed (I'm looking at you, WordPress!) we keep a log of where it was installed, and when new versions are released we update every copy that was installed. Again, you're more likely to find mod_security on a shared hosting server, as you're experiencing now.

No one who understands   both procedural and object-oriented   programming has ever given me a   consistent idea of what an   object-oriented program actually does.  Can someone please give me their ideas of the advantages of object-oriented programming? ",
        "Best answer": "From your blog, it seems that you're familiar with both imperative and functional programming, and that you're familiar with the basic concepts involved in object-oriented programming, but you've just never really had it \"click\" as to what makes it useful.  I'll try to explain in terms of that knowledge, and hope that it's helpful to you. At its core, OOP is a way to use the imperative paradigm to better manage high degrees of complexity by creating \"smart\" data structures that model the problem domain.  In a (standard procedural non-object-oriented) program, you've got two basic things: variables, and code that knows what to do with them.  The code takes input from the user and various other sources, stores it in variables, operates on it, and produces output data which goes to the user or various other locations. Object-oriented programming is a way to simplify your program by taking that basic pattern and repeating it on a smaller scale.  Just like a program is a large collection of data with code that knows what to do with it, each object is a small piece of data bound to code that knows what to do with it. By breaking down the problem domain into smaller pieces and making sure as much data as possible is bound directly to code that knows what to do with it, you make it a lot easier to reason about the process as a whole and also about the sub-issues that make up the process. By grouping data into object classes, you can centralize code related to that data, making relevant code easier both to find and to debug.  And by encapsulating the data behind access specifiers and only accessing it through methods, (or properties, if your language supports them,) you greatly reduce the potential for data corruption or the violation of invariants. And by using inheritance and polymorphism, you can reuse preexisting classes, customizing them to fit your specific needs, without having to either modify the originals or rewrite everything from the ground up.  (Which is a thing you should never do, if you can avoid it.)  Just be careful you understand your base object, or you could end up with killer kangaroos. To me, these are the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming: complexity management, code centralization and improved problem-domain modeling through the creation of object classes, inheritance and polymorphism, and increased safety without sacrificing power or control through the use of encapsulation and properties.  I hope this helps you understand why so many programmers find it useful. EDIT: In response to Joel's question in the comments,  Can you explain what an \"object-oriented program\" contains   (other than these fancy defintions you've outlined) that is fundamentally   different from an imperative program? How do you \"get the ball rolling?\"  A little disclaimer here.  My model of \"an object-oriented program\" is basically the Delphi model, which is very similar to the C#/.NET model since they were created by former Delphi team members.  What I'm saying here may not apply, or not apply as much, in other OO languages. An object-oriented program is one in which all the logic is structured around objects.  Of course this has to be bootstrapped somewhere.  Your typical Delphi program contains initialization code that creates a singleton object called Application.  At the start of the program, it calls Application.Initialize, then a call to Application.CreateForm for every form you want to load into memory from the beginning, and then Application.Run, which displays the main form on screen and starts up the input/event loop that forms the core of any interactive computer programs. Application and your forms poll for incoming events from the OS and translate them into method calls on your object.  One thing that's very common is the use of event handlers, or \"delegates\" in .NET-speak.  An object has a method that says, \"do X and Y, but also check to see if this particular event handler is assigned, and call it if it is.\"  An event handler is a method pointer--a very simple closure that contains a reference to the method and a reference to the object instance--that's used to extend the behavior of objects.  For example, if I have a button object on my form, I customize its behavior by attaching an OnClick event handler, which causes some other object to execute a method when the button is clicked. So in an object-oriented program, most of the work gets done by defining objects with certain responsibilities and linking them together, either through method pointers or by one object directly calling a method defined in another object's public interface.  (And now we're back to encapsulation.)  This is an idea that I had no concept of back before I took OOP classes in college. "

Why was a browser-side include tag never considered?  Or was it? Specifically with a tag that instructed the browser to include additional HTML from other sources. e.g. <include src=\"http://server/foo/bar.html\">.  Many folks will make javascript calls and fill innerHTML to accomplish the same, when the same outside a the javascript engine could be accomplished by the browser. It would have been painful to have nested <HTML>s <BODY>s (i.e.) but we have to consider that aspect anywhere anyway. ",

It was certainly requested by every newbie web author who hadn't worked out Server Side Includes yet, back in the early days on the www-html list. But in those days W3 were happy to completely ignore web author pressure. If cross-site inclusion were allowed it would be a security disaster. You could pull in a page from the user's bank and read content from it. (Originally, DOM scripting was limited, but you could still have read from document.links, document.images, scripting functions dropped by the target page, etc. Since then you can do what you like with imported content.) If cross-site inclusion weren't allowed... well then the feature wouldn't have any advantage over server-side includes. It'd be more, slower work for the client to do that the server could have dealt with better. Unlike <iframe>, an include would have to block page loading. SSIs would be in every way superior. "

        "Best answer": "Probably a legacy thing. Bitwise operations may not be very common nowadays, but when coding on very low level you use them all the time. So when C was deviced in the 70's or whenever it was created, bitwise OPs were probably more common than logical OPs. And since C has it that way, I take it many other languages (such as Java, indirectly from C++) followed the same convention. Now that I've used the double notation (&& and ||) for so long, I'd only be confused if they were switched. But for completely new programmers, it would probably be a nice thing: you save a whopping 50% per logical operation!

Is there any other simple trick you use on your own developments? ",
        "Best answer": "insert premature-discussion-is-the-root-of-all-evil lecture That said, here are some habits I've gotten into to avoid unnecessary efficiency, and in some cases, make my code simpler and more correct as well. This isn't a discussion of general principles, but of some things to be aware of to avoid introducing unnecessary inefficiencies into code. Know your big-O This should probably be merged into the lengthy discussion above.  It's pretty much common sense that a loop inside of a loop, where the inner loop repeats a calculation, is gonna be slower.  For example: for (i = 0; i < strlen(str); i++) {     ... }  This will take a horrendous amount of time if the string is really long, because the length is being recalculated on every iteration of the loop.  Note that GCC actually optimizes this case because strlen() is marked as a pure function. When sorting a million 32-bit integers, bubble sort would be the wrong way to go.  In general, sorting can be done in O(n * log n) time (or better, in the case of radix sort), so unless you know your data is going to be small, look for an algorithm that's at least O(n * log n). Likewise, when dealing with databases, be aware of indexes.  If you SELECT * FROM people WHERE age = 20, and you don't have an index on people(age), it'll require an O(n) sequential scan rather than a much faster O(log n) index scan. Integer arithmetic hierarchy When programming in C, bear in mind that some arithmetic operations are more expensive than others.  For integers, the hierarchy goes something like this (least expensive first):  + - ~ & | ^ << >> * /  Granted, the compiler will usually optimize things like n / 2 to n >> 1 automatically if you're targeting a mainstream computer, but if you're targeting an embedded device, you might not get that luxury. Also, % 2 and & 1 have different semantics.  Division and modulus usually rounds toward zero, but it's implementation defined.  Good ol' >> and & always rounds toward negative infinity, which (in my opinion) makes a lot more sense.  For instance, on my computer: printf(\"%d\\n\", -1 % 2); // -1 (maybe) printf(\"%d\\n\", -1 & 1); // 1  Hence, use what makes sense.  Don't think you're being a good boy by using % 2 when you were originally going to write & 1. Expensive floating point operations Avoid heavy floating point operations like pow() and log() in code that doesn't really need them, especially when dealing with integers.  Take, for example, reading a number: int parseInt(const char *str) {     const char *p;     int         digits;     int         number;     int         position;      // Count the number of digits     for (p = str; isdigit(*p); p++)         {}     digits = p - str;      // Sum the digits, multiplying them by their respective power of 10.     number = 0;     position = digits - 1;     for (p = str; isdigit(*p); p++, position--)         number += (*p - '0') * pow(10, position);      return number; }  Not only is this use of pow() (and the int<->double conversions needed to use it) rather expensive, but it creates an opportunity for precision loss (incidentally, the code above doesn't have precision issues).  That's why I wince when I see this type of function used in a non-mathematical context. Also, notice how the \"clever\" algorithm below, which multiplies by 10 on each iteration, is actually more concise than the code above: int parseInt(const char *str) {     const char *p;     int         number;      number = 0;     for (p = str; isdigit(*p); p++) {         number *= 10;         number += *p - '0';     }      return number; }  "

        "Question": "Linguistic relativity is the idea that language shapes the way we think.  My question is, how much, and to what extent, does this apply to programming?  Are some native, natural languages better-suited for thinking about programming than others?  For instance, can the following be stated more concisely in a non-English language?  Select a pivot.  Move all the items less than the pivot to one side of the list, and all the items greater than the pivot to the other side. Does a Chinese-speaking programmer view programming in a radically different lens than an English-speaking programmer, or do the differences fade away when both are immersed in the subject? Are some programming languages and domains easier to think about in one language or another.  For instance, is it any easier to grok Ruby if you are Japanese because the creator of Ruby is Japanese?  Note that this question is not focused on \"how do programming languages affect the way people think about programming\", but rather \"how do natural languages affect the way people think about programming\". To get it out of the way, one language that clearly has a pragmatic advantage is English.  I think the advantage has little to do with programming languages choosing English keywords like if, for, while, and do, just as musicians who don't speak Italian aren't tripped up by words like forte.  It has more to do with communication of ideas with other programmers, as English is the lingua franca these days, at least in the programming world.  For instance, to ask a question in StackOverflow, you really need to know English and know it pretty well if you want good answers.  Although this sounds like an imperialist attitude, it really is true in practice. That aside, how do the intrinsic properties of languages affect how programmers who speak them think about data structures, algorithms, etc.?

EDIT: Is there nobody who has an opposing opinion? Bertrand Meyer (creator of Eiffel back in 1985/1986) calls method overloading this: (source)  a vanity mechanism that brings nothing to the semantic power of an O-O language, but hampers readability and complicates everyone's task  Now those are some sweeping generalizations, but he's a smart guy, so I think it's safe to say he could back them up if he needed to. In fact, he almost had Brad Abrams (one of the CLSv1 developers) convinced that .NET shouldn't support method overloading. (source) That's some powerful stuff. Can anyone shed some light on his thoughts, and whether his viewpoint is still justified 25 years later? ",
        "Best answer": "Function overloading is absolutely critical for C++-style template code.  If I have to use different function names for different types, I can't write generic code.  That would eliminate a large and heavily used part of the C++ library, and much of C++'s functionality. It's usually present in member function names.  A.foo() can call an entirely different function from B.foo(), but both functions are named foo.  It's present in operators, as + does different things when applied to integers and floating-point numbers, and it's often used as a string concatenation operator.  It seems odd not to allow it in regular functions as well. It enables the use of Common Lisp-style \"multimethods\", in which the exact function called depends on two data types.  If you haven't programmed in the Common Lisp Object System, try it before you call this useless.  It's vital for C++ streams. I/O without function overloading (or variadic functions, which are worse) would require a number of different functions, either to print values of different types or to convert values of different types to a common type (like String). Without function overloading, if I change the type of some variable or value I need to change every function that uses it.  It makes it much harder to refactor code. It makes it easier to use APIs when the user doesn't have to remember which type naming convention is in use, and the user can just remember standard function names. Without operator overloading, we'd have to label each function with the types it uses, if that base operation can be used on more than one type.  This is essentially Hungarian notation, the bad way of doing it. Overall, it makes a language far more usable. "

I first started by putting const to really read-only members of my most basic class members and member functions arguments. From there, I couldn't compile anymore. Then I persevered in going in the code using those basic classes, see if the previously const additions were really legitimate compared to the use I made of them. It helped me fix some bugs on the way as I added constness to other parts of the code. It's contagious. Most of the code got even more constness and I found easier to debug it because it makes you confident that the compiler will stop you if you start modifying something you shouldn't.  Once I got the application running again, it was faster (had to change some algorithms that I've discovered weren't right for the job), with a lot less bugs and easier to understand when reading the code. I was convinced.  Now, I think that it's even better when you're using a lot of assertions in addition to constness because it makes you feel confident when you have to write new code or modify the current code. You know the compiler will stop you if necessary.
