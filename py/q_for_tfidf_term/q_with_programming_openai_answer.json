        "Question": "During my four years at university we have been using much functional programming in several functional programming languages. But I have also used much object oriented programming to, and in fact I use object oriented languages more when doing my own small project to prepare for my first job. But I often wish that I was coding in a functional programming language when doing these projects. However, when looking for a job, it is very rare to see a job where knowledge of a functional programming language is required. Why isn't functional programming languages used more in the industry? There is quite much news about functional programming languages these days, so I wonder if functional programming is catching on in the industry now? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Functional programming has been gaining popularity in recent years due to its ability to improve code quality, maintainability, and scalability. However, the adoption of functional programming languages in industry has been somewhat slow compared to object-oriented languages.  One reason for this slower adoption is the fact that many companies already have a significant investment in object-oriented codebases and infrastructure. Switching to a functional programming approach would require a significant amount of time and resources, which many companies may be hesitant to commit to.  Additionally, functional programming can be perceived as more complex and harder to learn compared to object-oriented programming. This can make it more difficult for companies to find developers with the necessary skills and experience in functional programming languages.  That being said, there has been a growing interest in functional programming in recent years, with more companies starting to explore its potential benefits. As more developers become familiar with functional programming concepts and languages, we may see an increase in demand for these skills in the industry.  Ultimately, the decision to use functional programming in industry will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific requirements of the project, the existing codebase, and the availability of developers with the necessary skills. As the benefits of functional programming become more widely recognized, we may see a shift towards its increased adoption in the industry.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I would say that one of the reasons that functional programming is not more prevalent is the lack of knowledge base.  My experience is that corporations are very risk averse in terms of implementing technologies that are not main stream and would rather invest in tried and true frameworks (java, c++, c#).  It's only when there is a business need (like in Ericsson) that new paradigms are considered.  But even in Ericsson's case I heard that management demanded that c++ be used and Joe Armstrong was compelled to code erlang calls in c++!! This should show how reluctant corporations are to implement new technologies! ",
        "Are the two answers equivalent?": "No. There are some similarities in the points made in both answers, but they are not equivalent. Answer 1 provides a more detailed and balanced overview of the factors influencing the adoption of functional programming in industry, while Answer 2 focuses on the reluctance of corporations to implement new technologies and provides a specific example to illustrate this point."

        "Question": "Are there any great programming or software development books that are language agnostic?  Why should I read it? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Yes, \"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship\" by Robert C. Martin is a great programming book that is language agnostic. This book focuses on best practices and principles for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code, regardless of the programming language being used.   Reading this book can help you improve your coding skills, learn best practices for software development, and become a better programmer overall. It provides valuable insights and tips that can be applied to any programming language, making it a valuable resource for developers of all levels.",

        "Question": "No matter how much you love a programming language, there are always a few details in it that aren\u2019t quite as nice as they could be. In this question, I would like to specifically focus on syntax elements. In a programming language that you use frequently (perhaps your favourite programming language, or perhaps the one you are forced to use at work), which syntax element do you find most unreadable, unclear, inconvenient or unpleasant? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One syntax element that I find particularly unpleasant in the programming language I use frequently is the use of curly braces { } in defining code blocks. While I understand that curly braces are a standard way of delineating code blocks in many languages, I find that they can sometimes make the code harder to read and follow, especially when dealing with nested blocks or long lines of code.  I often have trouble keeping track of which curly brace corresponds to which opening or closing block, leading to errors and confusion. Additionally, the placement of curly braces can sometimes be inconsistent or unclear, further complicating the readability of the code.  I would prefer a syntax that uses indentation or other markers to define code blocks, as I find this to be a more intuitive and visually appealing way of organizing code. However, since curly braces are a standard syntax element in many languages, I have learned to work with them, but I still find them to be a less than ideal aspect of the language.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Semicolon insertion in JavaScript. I haven't really been bitten by it often, but it's just such a phenomenally bad idea it makes my head spin.  Here's the rules (from ECMA-262 Section 7.9)  When the program contains a token that is not allowed by the formal grammar, then a semicolon is inserted if (a) there is a line break at that point, or (b) the unexpected token was a closing brace. When the end of a file is reached, if the program cannot be parsed otherwise, then a semicolon is inserted. When a \"restricted production\" is encountered and contains a line terminator in a place where the grammar contains the annotation \"[no LineTerminator here]\", then a semicolon is inserted.    Example: return 1; // returns 1  return 1; // returns undefined  ",

        "Question": "When learning a new programming language you sometimes come across a language feature which  makes you wish you had it in your other programming languages that you know. What are some language feature which were at the time of learning very new to you and that you wish your other programming languages had.   An example of this is generators in Python or C#. Other examples may include list comprehensions in Python, template in C++ or LINQ in .NET or lazy evaluation in Haskell. What other semi-unique language features have you come across which were completely new and enlightening to you?  Are there other features of older programming languages which were unique and have fallen out of fashion? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "1. Pattern matching in functional programming languages like Erlang or Elixir. This feature allows for concise and readable code when working with complex data structures.  2. Type inference in languages like Haskell or Swift. This feature allows for the compiler to automatically deduce the data types of variables without explicit declarations, leading to less boilerplate code.  3. Higher order functions in languages like JavaScript or Scala. This feature allows functions to be passed as arguments to other functions or returned as values, enabling powerful functional programming paradigms.  4. Asynchronous programming in languages like JavaScript or Python. This feature allows for non-blocking execution of code, improving performance and responsiveness in applications.  5. Macros in Lisp or Clojure. This feature allows for code generation and manipulation at compile-time, which can greatly enhance the flexibility and expressiveness of a programming language.  Older programming languages like COBOL or Fortran had unique features such as explicit control over memory management or direct access to hardware, which have fallen out of fashion with the rise of higher-level languages and modern programming paradigms like object-oriented programming and functional programming. However, some of these features are still valuable in certain niche areas and are still maintained and used by legacy systems.",
