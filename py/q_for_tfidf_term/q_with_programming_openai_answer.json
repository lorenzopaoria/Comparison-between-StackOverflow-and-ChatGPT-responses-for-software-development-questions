        "Question": "During my four years at university we have been using much functional programming in several functional programming languages. But I have also used much object oriented programming to, and in fact I use object oriented languages more when doing my own small project to prepare for my first job. But I often wish that I was coding in a functional programming language when doing these projects. However, when looking for a job, it is very rare to see a job where knowledge of a functional programming language is required. Why isn't functional programming languages used more in the industry? There is quite much news about functional programming languages these days, so I wonder if functional programming is catching on in the industry now? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Functional programming has been gaining popularity in recent years due to its ability to handle complex problems more effectively and efficiently than traditional object-oriented programming languages. However, the adoption of functional programming in the industry has been slower than expected for several reasons.  One of the main reasons for the slower adoption of functional programming languages in the industry is the lack of experienced developers who are proficient in these languages. Many companies are hesitant to invest in training their existing developers in functional programming, as it requires a different mindset and approach to coding compared to object-oriented programming.  Additionally, functional programming languages are often seen as less practical for building large-scale applications, as they can be more challenging to debug and maintain. Object-oriented programming languages, on the other hand, have been around for much longer and have a larger community of developers who are familiar with them.  However, there has been a growing interest in functional programming languages in recent years, with companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix adopting languages like Scala, Clojure, and Haskell for certain projects. As more developers become proficient in functional programming languages and as the benefits of using these languages become more apparent, we may see a shift towards greater adoption of functional programming in the industry in the coming years.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I was a professor and, just like programmers, professors are always looking for the Next Big Thing. When they think they've found one, they make it a bandwagon, and everyone piles on. Since they are preaching to students who think professors must be really smart, else why would they be professors, they get no resistance. Functional programming is such a bandwagon. Sure it's got lots of nice interesting questions to investigate, and lots of sort-of-interesting conference articles to write. It's not a particularly new idea, and you can do it in just about any modern language, and ideas don't have to be new to be interesting. It's also a good skill to have. Given that, functional programming is just one arrow to have in your quiver, not the only one, just as OOP is not the only one. My beef with computer science academia is lack of practical interplay with industry to determine what actually makes real-world sense, i.e. quality control. If that quality control were there, there might be a different emphasis, on classifying problems and the ranges of solutions to them, with tradeoffs, rather than just the latest bandwagons. ",

        "ChatGpt answer": "Yes, there are several great programming or software development books that are language agnostic. One example is \"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship\" by Robert C. Martin. This book focuses on writing clean, maintainable, and high-quality code, regardless of the programming language being used.  You should read language-agnostic books like \"Clean Code\" because they teach fundamental principles and best practices that apply to any programming language. By understanding these concepts, you can improve your programming skills and become a more effective developer, no matter what language you are working with. Additionally, mastering these principles can help you write better code, collaborate more effectively with team members, and ultimately create more successful software projects.",

        "Question": "No matter how much you love a programming language, there are always a few details in it that aren\u2019t quite as nice as they could be. In this question, I would like to specifically focus on syntax elements. In a programming language that you use frequently (perhaps your favourite programming language, or perhaps the one you are forced to use at work), which syntax element do you find most unreadable, unclear, inconvenient or unpleasant? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "As a frequent user of Python, one syntax element that I find particularly inconvenient is the use of indentation to denote blocks of code. While I understand the reasoning behind this design choice (promoting clean and readable code), it can be frustrating when you accidentally misplace an indentation and your code stops working as expected. Additionally, when working with nested loops or conditional statements, maintaining consistent indentation levels can be tedious and error-prone.  Furthermore, the lack of explicit block delimiters like curly braces in other languages can make it difficult to quickly identify where a block of code begins and ends, especially in larger projects with multiple levels of nesting. Overall, while I appreciate the aesthetic benefits of Python's indentation-based syntax, I find it can sometimes be more trouble than it's worth.",

Here's the rules (from ECMA-262 Section 7.9)  When the program contains a token that is not allowed by the formal grammar, then a semicolon is inserted if (a) there is a line break at that point, or (b) the unexpected token was a closing brace. When the end of a file is reached, if the program cannot be parsed otherwise, then a semicolon is inserted.

        "Question": "When learning a new programming language you sometimes come across a language feature which  makes you wish you had it in your other programming languages that you know. What are some language feature which were at the time of learning very new to you and that you wish your other programming languages had.   An example of this is generators in Python or C#. Other examples may include list comprehensions in Python, template in C++ or LINQ in .NET or lazy evaluation in Haskell. What other semi-unique language features have you come across which were completely new and enlightening to you?  Are there other features of older programming languages which were unique and have fallen out of fashion? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One language feature that I found very new and useful when learning Rust was its ownership system. The borrow checker in Rust ensures memory safety by enforcing strict rules regarding ownership and borrowing of variables. This was a new concept for me when I was learning Rust, but I found it extremely helpful in writing safe and efficient code. I wish other programming languages had a similar system for managing memory allocation and deallocation.  Another feature that I found interesting when learning Scala was pattern matching. Pattern matching allows for more concise and readable code by matching data structures against a set of patterns and extracting values from them. This feature was new to me at the time, but I found it very powerful and wished other languages had something similar.  In terms of older programming languages, one unique feature that has fallen out of fashion is the use of pointers in languages like C and C++. Pointers allow for direct access to memory addresses, which can be very powerful but also error-prone. With the rise of higher-level languages that abstract away memory management, pointers are used less frequently in modern programming practices.  Overall, I think it's always interesting to discover new language features that can improve the way we write code. Whether it's something unique to a specific language or a concept that can be applied across multiple languages, learning about these features can expand our programming toolkit and make us better developers.",

        "ChatGpt answer": "There could be various reasons why literate programming has not become mainstream. One reason could be that traditional programming methods are more widely accepted and understood, making it difficult for a new methodology like literate programming to gain traction.  Additionally, implementing literate programming practices requires a different mindset and approach to coding, which may be challenging for some developers to adapt to. There may also be a lack of tools and resources available to support literate programming, making it less accessible and convenient for developers to use.  It is also possible that literate programming has not been widely adopted because it has not been effectively marketed or promoted to the programming community. Ultimately, the success or failure of literate programming may depend on a combination of these factors, rather than solely on its ability to deliver on its promises.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I first saw it in a book of Knuth's writings, and thought it looked neat.  Then I tried to use the literary programming display to comprehend what was going on in the program, and found it harder than it looked.  It may have been that I was too used to going through program listings, but it seemed confusing. Then I looked at the source code, and that turned me off then and there.  I'd have to learn to write programs in an entirely new way, with less correspondence between the program text and what the compiler saw, and saw no corresponding benefit. In addition, people can write long and convincing arguments that the code is doing X when it's actually doing Y, and I've run into my share of misleading comments.  I developed a fondness for reading the code to see what it's doing fairly early.  Literate programming is the antithesis of that. ",

        "Question": "For decades, the accepted degree to get to become a software developer was \"Compter Science.\" We've had a few questions already about whether that degree really prepares students to develop software. Some schools have, in the last 8 years or so, started offering multiple distinct majors in programming.  Using the curriculum from my school:  Computer Science, which starts out with some intro programming courses in the first year, and then focuses on theoretical computer science, algorithms, and a bit of OS stuff.  Most classes involve several smaller projects and homeworks, done solo or in pairs. Software Engineering, which starts out with the same intro programming courses, does a few classes of theory, and then goes into software development practices (testing, process methodologies, sofware metrics, requirements gathering) and software design (distributed system design, info system design, real-time/embedded design, subsystem design, etc)  Different schools do it differently, so the above is just a real-world example I'm familiar with.  What I ask is: Is there a need for distinct majors in programming? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There is definitely a need for distinct majors in programming, as the field of software development is vast and encompasses a wide variety of specialized skills and knowledge. While a degree in Computer Science provides a solid foundation in theoretical concepts and algorithms, it may not fully prepare students for the practical aspects of software development, such as software design and engineering practices.  A major in Software Engineering, on the other hand, provides students with a more focused curriculum that emphasizes skills and knowledge directly relevant to software development in real-world environments. This can include courses on software testing, system design, requirements gathering, and other crucial aspects of the software development process.  By offering distinct majors in programming, schools can better cater to the diverse needs and interests of students who are looking to pursue a career in software development. This allows students to choose a path that aligns with their specific goals and interests, whether they are more interested in the theoretical aspects of computer science or the practical aspects of software engineering.  Overall, having distinct majors in programming helps to ensure that students are well-prepared for the demands of the software development industry, and can ultimately lead to a more skilled and knowledgeable workforce in the field.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Yes, they should be. The relationship between computer science and software engineering is the same as the relationship between physics and mechanical engineering. One provides the theoretical background while the other takes those theories, along with good engineering principles, and applies them to the design and implementation of software. You need both in order to produce new and better software. A good computer science education trains people to produce new and better algorithms, data structures, programming languages and paradigms, compilers, and a number of other things that can be used to enhance software systems. A good software engineering education, on the other hand, trains you to take these tools and knowledge obtained through a scientific study of computation, along with a knowledge of the software development lifecycle and process models to actually build the system that a customer wants and needs.

        "ChatGpt answer": "Another book that I would recommend is \"The Design of Everyday Things\" by Don Norman. This book focuses on the principles of good design and usability, which are crucial aspects of creating user-friendly and efficient software and applications. Understanding the importance of human-centered design can greatly improve the quality of your work as a programmer.  \"The Lean Startup\" by Eric Ries is another great read for programmers and developers. This book introduces the concept of lean methodology, which emphasizes the importance of rapid experimentation, iteration, and validation of ideas. Implementing lean principles can help you create products that better meet user needs and maximize efficiency in development processes.  Lastly, \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" by Daniel Kahneman is a fascinating book that explores the two systems of thinking that drive decision making - intuitive, quick thinking and logical, deliberate thinking. Understanding these cognitive processes can help you make better choices in your coding decisions and problem-solving strategies.  These books, while not directly related to programming, offer valuable insights and perspectives that can greatly benefit programmers and developers in their work.

You can of course talk about programming with other programmers, and there is peer programming, and you do get to create something that you can show to people, but when it comes to explaining to non programmers what is it that you do, or how was your day at work, it's sort of tricky.

        "ChatGpt answer": "One approach is to use analogies to explain your work in a way that non-programmers can relate to. For example, you could compare coding to building a house, where each line of code is like a brick or a piece of furniture that comes together to create a functional and beautiful structure. Another analogy could be comparing programming to cooking, where you have a set of ingredients (code) that you mix together (write) to create a delicious dish (program).  You could also try to focus on the real-world impact of your work. For example, you could explain how the software you develop helps businesses streamline their processes, improves user experiences, or solves complex problems. By highlighting the practical applications of programming, you can help non-programmers understand the value of your work.  Additionally, you could show non-programmers some of the projects you have completed or are working on. This could help them see the tangible results of your coding skills and get a better sense of what you do on a day-to-day basis. You could also invite them to sit in on a coding session or explain a simple coding concept to them to give them a hands-on experience of your work.

        "Question": "why not combine the best features of the all existent programming languages and fit it in a universal programming language? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "While it may seem appealing to have a universal programming language that combines the best features of all existing languages, there are several challenges and limitations to consider:  1. Complexity: The more features and capabilities a programming language has, the more complex it becomes. Combining multiple languages into one universal language could result in a language that is difficult to learn, understand, and use effectively.  2. Compatibility: Each programming language has its own syntax, semantics, and conventions, which may not always be compatible with other languages. Integrating these diverse features into a single language could lead to compatibility issues and make it challenging to work with existing codebases and tools.  3. Performance: Different languages are optimized for specific tasks and have different performance characteristics. Combining all these features into one language could result in a language that is not well-suited for any particular task, leading to suboptimal performance.  4. Community and ecosystem: Programming languages often have dedicated communities and ecosystems that support and enhance the language. A universal language may struggle to build a cohesive community and ecosystem due to the disparate features and preferences of users from different language backgrounds.  Overall, while the idea of a universal programming language is appealing, the reality is that it is not a practical or feasible solution due to the complexities and challenges involved in combining the vast array of features and capabilities present in existing languages. It is more effective to choose the right language for a specific task or problem, leveraging the strengths and features of existing languages rather than trying to create a one-size-fits-all solution.",

This posting is my most popular, as people seem to type \"I don't get object-oriented programming\" into Google a lot.  Feel free to answer here, or in a comment at Wordpress.  What is object-oriented programming?    No one has given me a satisfactory   answer.  I feel like you will not get   a good definition from someone who   goes around saying \u201cobject\u201d and   \u201cobject-oriented\u201d with his nose in the   air. Nor will you get a good   definition from someone who has done   nothing but object-oriented   programming. No one who understands   both procedural and object-oriented   programming has ever given me a   consistent idea of what an   object-oriented program actually does.  Can someone please give me their ideas of the advantages of object-oriented programming? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (methods or functions). Objects can interact with one another through message passing.  The advantages of object-oriented programming include: 1. Modularity: Object-oriented programming allows for the decomposition of a complex system into smaller, more manageable units (objects), which can be developed and maintained independently. 2. Reusability: Objects can be reused in different contexts or projects, reducing the need to write code from scratch and promoting code reusability. 3. Encapsulation: Objects encapsulate data and behavior, hiding the internal details and exposing only what is necessary. This helps in maintaining the integrity and consistency of the system. 4. Inheritance: Object-oriented programming supports inheritance, allowing classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. This promotes code reuse and helps in building hierarchies of classes. 5. Polymorphism: Objects can exhibit different behaviors based on their type or class, allowing for a more flexible and dynamic code structure.  Overall, object-oriented programming promotes code organization, enhances code reusability, and improves code maintainability and scalability. It is a powerful paradigm that can help developers build complex software systems in a more efficient and organized manner.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "From your blog, it seems that you're familiar with both imperative and functional programming, and that you're familiar with the basic concepts involved in object-oriented programming, but you've just never really had it \"click\" as to what makes it useful.  I'll try to explain in terms of that knowledge, and hope that it's helpful to you. At its core, OOP is a way to use the imperative paradigm to better manage high degrees of complexity by creating \"smart\" data structures that model the problem domain.  In a (standard procedural non-object-oriented) program, you've got two basic things: variables, and code that knows what to do with them.  The code takes input from the user and various other sources, stores it in variables, operates on it, and produces output data which goes to the user or various other locations. Object-oriented programming is a way to simplify your program by taking that basic pattern and repeating it on a smaller scale.  Just like a program is a large collection of data with code that knows what to do with it, each object is a small piece of data bound to code that knows what to do with it. By breaking down the problem domain into smaller pieces and making sure as much data as possible is bound directly to code that knows what to do with it, you make it a lot easier to reason about the process as a whole and also about the sub-issues that make up the process. By grouping data into object classes, you can centralize code related to that data, making relevant code easier both to find and to debug.  And by encapsulating the data behind access specifiers and only accessing it through methods, (or properties, if your language supports them,) you greatly reduce the potential for data corruption or the violation of invariants. And by using inheritance and polymorphism, you can reuse preexisting classes, customizing them to fit your specific needs, without having to either modify the originals or rewrite everything from the ground up.  (Which is a thing you should never do, if you can avoid it.)  Just be careful you understand your base object, or you could end up with killer kangaroos. To me, these are the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming: complexity management, code centralization and improved problem-domain modeling through the creation of object classes, inheritance and polymorphism, and increased safety without sacrificing power or control through the use of encapsulation and properties.  I hope this helps you understand why so many programmers find it useful. EDIT: In response to Joel's question in the comments,  Can you explain what an \"object-oriented program\" contains   (other than these fancy defintions you've outlined) that is fundamentally   different from an imperative program? How do you \"get the ball rolling?\"  A little disclaimer here.  My model of \"an object-oriented program\" is basically the Delphi model, which is very similar to the C#/.NET model since they were created by former Delphi team members.  What I'm saying here may not apply, or not apply as much, in other OO languages. An object-oriented program is one in which all the logic is structured around objects.  Of course this has to be bootstrapped somewhere.  Your typical Delphi program contains initialization code that creates a singleton object called Application.  At the start of the program, it calls Application.Initialize, then a call to Application.CreateForm for every form you want to load into memory from the beginning, and then Application.Run, which displays the main form on screen and starts up the input/event loop that forms the core of any interactive computer programs. Application and your forms poll for incoming events from the OS and translate them into method calls on your object.  One thing that's very common is the use of event handlers, or \"delegates\" in .NET-speak.  An object has a method that says, \"do X and Y, but also check to see if this particular event handler is assigned, and call it if it is.\"  An event handler is a method pointer--a very simple closure that contains a reference to the method and a reference to the object instance--that's used to extend the behavior of objects.  For example, if I have a button object on my form, I customize its behavior by attaching an OnClick event handler, which causes some other object to execute a method when the button is clicked. So in an object-oriented program, most of the work gets done by defining objects with certain responsibilities and linking them together, either through method pointers or by one object directly calling a method defined in another object's public interface.  (And now we're back to encapsulation.)  This is an idea that I had no concept of back before I took OOP classes in college. ",

        "Question": "Linguistic relativity is the idea that language shapes the way we think.  My question is, how much, and to what extent, does this apply to programming?  Are some native, natural languages better-suited for thinking about programming than others?  For instance, can the following be stated more concisely in a non-English language?  Select a pivot.  Move all the items less than the pivot to one side of the list, and all the items greater than the pivot to the other side. Does a Chinese-speaking programmer view programming in a radically different lens than an English-speaking programmer, or do the differences fade away when both are immersed in the subject? Are some programming languages and domains easier to think about in one language or another.  For instance, is it any easier to grok Ruby if you are Japanese because the creator of Ruby is Japanese?  Note that this question is not focused on \"how do programming languages affect the way people think about programming\", but rather \"how do natural languages affect the way people think about programming\". To get it out of the way, one language that clearly has a pragmatic advantage is English.  I think the advantage has little to do with programming languages choosing English keywords like if, for, while, and do, just as musicians who don't speak Italian aren't tripped up by words like forte.  It has more to do with communication of ideas with other programmers, as English is the lingua franca these days, at least in the programming world.  For instance, to ask a question in StackOverflow, you really need to know English and know it pretty well if you want good answers.  Although this sounds like an imperialist attitude, it really is true in practice. That aside, how do the intrinsic properties of languages affect how programmers who speak them think about data structures, algorithms, etc.?  Are any languages particularly concise when it comes to talking about logic and programming, allowing native speakers of those languages to think faster? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There is limited research on how natural languages affect the way people think about programming, but it is reasonable to assume that there may be some influence. For example, some languages may have grammatical structures that make certain programming concepts easier or harder to express. Additionally, cultural influences and linguistic nuances in a programmer's native language could potentially impact their approach to problem-solving in programming.  In terms of specific programming languages, it is possible that certain languages are easier to understand and think about for speakers of certain natural languages. For example, a Japanese speaker may find Ruby easier to understand due to the fact that it was created by a Japanese programmer. Similarly, a Chinese speaker may have a different perspective on programming concepts compared to an English speaker.   Overall, while natural language may have some impact on the way people think about programming, the differences may fade away when individuals are immersed in the subject and gain proficiency in multiple programming languages. The most important factor is likely the individual's experience, problem-solving abilities, and familiarity with the programming concepts rather than their native language.",

Different languages have different strengths and weaknesses, and serve various purposes such as web development, data analysis, game development, and more.  There are several reasons why someone might create a new programming language even though there are already existing languages. These reasons include:  1. Addressing specific needs: Sometimes existing languages may not have the features or capabilities needed for a particular task or industry. A new language may be created to address these specific needs and provide better solutions.  2. Improving efficiency: New languages may be designed to be more efficient, easier to use, or more expressive than existing languages. This can help developers write code faster, reduce errors, and improve productivity.  3. Experimentation and research: Creating a new language can be a way for researchers and developers to experiment with new ideas, concepts, and programming paradigms. This can lead to innovations and advancements in the field of programming languages.  4. Personal preference: Some developers may simply prefer to work with a language that they have created themselves, either for personal satisfaction or to better suit their own coding style and preferences.

I'm not even a social person. I have however never actually worked with true pair programming (besides few times for a short time to help someone else or to solve a complex task together)... so it is pair programming really that bad?

I don't like to watch someone else coding, I like to listen to music, I feel I'll be quicker working on my own, I don't want to stop and explain myself constantly, etc etc etc. Then I tried it.  And guess what?  It still sucked.  We were having all kinds of problems - I wanted to work different hours to the other guy, we had different keyboard settings and shortcuts, our desks didn't work very well for pair programming etc etc. This went on for about a week.  During that week we were rewriting the entire legacy login system for a distributed application.  We had to learn how some seriously difficult threading issues work, figure out how remoting sinks worked, change tons and tons of legacy code to work with our new login module and pretty much do some of the most hectic coding I've had to do in my career.  After a week of this we deployed it.. and everything just worked.  Not a single bug.  Not one. That's when I figured there might be something to this pair programming nonsense.  We started to do more pair programming.  We even started to force everyone to work in pairs.  It rocked.  I probably learnt more in a month of doing that than I did in the previous 2 years.

In comparison to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or be more portable across platforms. Such languages hide the details of CPU operations such as memory access models and management of scope.  I.e., as the level of programming language increases, the further away the programmer goes from the hardware on which the program runs. Now I do not know the statistics of language usages across levels, but I would suspect that the higher level languages more and more are replacing the lower level languages.

        "ChatGpt answer": "One of the strongest arguments against functional programming is that it can be more difficult for programmers to understand and work with compared to more traditional imperative programming paradigms. Functional programming requires thinking in terms of functions, higher-order functions, recursion, and immutability, which can be more abstract and challenging for some developers to grasp. This can lead to slower development time and potentially lower productivity in a team setting.  Additionally, functional programming can be less efficient in terms of performance due to factors such as the creation of new data structures and functions for each operation, as well as potential overhead from features like currying and lazy evaluation. This can be a concern for applications requiring high performance or low level optimization.  Furthermore, the lack of mutable state in functional programming can make it more difficult to model certain types of real-world problems, particularly those involving complex state transitions or interactions with external systems. This can lead to more verbose and less intuitive code compared to imperative programming paradigms.  Overall, while functional programming has its advantages in terms of readability, maintainability, and scalability, it may not always be the best choice for every project or team depending on the specific requirements and constraints.",

        "ChatGpt answer": "Functional programming and object-oriented programming are two different approaches to writing code, each with its own set of benefits and drawbacks.  Functional programming: Pros: 1. Immutability: In functional programming, data is immutable, meaning that once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed. This can help prevent bugs by reducing side effects. 2. Higher-order functions: Functional programming allows for the passing of functions as arguments to other functions, which can lead to more concise and modular code. 3. Parallelism: Functional programming lends itself well to parallel processing, making it easier to take advantage of multi-core processors. 4. Easier debugging: Because functions in functional programming are pure and do not have side effects, they are easier to test and debug.  Cons: 1. Steeper learning curve: Functional programming can be more challenging to learn for developers who are used to object-oriented programming. 2. Limited industry adoption: Functional programming is less commonly used in industry compared to object-oriented programming, so finding resources and support may be more difficult. 3. Performance issues: Some functional programming languages may have performance issues due to the overhead of functional constructs.  Object-oriented programming: Pros: 1. Modularity: Object-oriented programming allows for the organization of code into classes and objects, making it easier to manage and scale larger programs. 2. Code reusability: Object-oriented programming promotes code reusability through inheritance and polymorphism, reducing the need for duplicate code. 3. Encapsulation: Object-oriented programming emphasizes encapsulation, which helps to hide implementation details and reduce dependencies between classes.  Cons: 1. Mutability: Object-oriented programming allows for mutable data, which can lead to bugs and unexpected behavior. 2. Complexity: Object-oriented programming can become complex and difficult to maintain, especially in large codebases. 3. Performance overhead: Object-oriented programming can have performance overhead due to the overhead of managing objects and classes.  In conclusion, both functional programming and object-oriented programming have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between the two largely depends on the specific requirements and constraints of a project. Developers should consider factors such as the complexity of the project, the team's familiarity with the programming paradigm, and the performance requirements when deciding between functional and object-oriented programming.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I would say that it is more Functional Programming vs Imperative Programming. The biggest difference is that Imperative programming is about Control flow while Functional programming is about Data flow. Another way to say it is that functional programming only uses expressions while in imperative programming both expressions and statements are used. For example, in imperative programming variables and loops are common when handling state, while in functional programming the state is handled via parameter passing, which avoids side-effects and assignments. Imperative pseudo-code for a function for calculate the sum of a list (the sum is kept in a variable): int sumList(List<int> list) {     int sum = 0;     for(int n = 0; n < list.size(); n++) {         sum = sum + list.get(n);     }      return sum; }  Functional pseudo-code for the same function (the sum is passed as a parameter): fun sumList([], sum) = sum  |  sumList(v::lst, sum) = sumList(lst, v+sum)  I recommend the presentation Taming Effects with Functional Programming by Simon Peyton-Jones for a good introduction to functional concepts.

By enforcing consistent naming conventions, case sensitivity can make it easier for developers to understand and follow code written by others.  2. It allows for more flexibility in naming variables and functions. With case sensitivity, developers can create distinct identifiers by simply changing the capitalization of letters, which can be helpful in avoiding naming conflicts.  3. Case sensitivity can also help prevent errors in code by alerting developers to typos or misspellings in variable names. For example, if a variable is declared as \"myVar\" but later referenced as \"MyVar\", the compiler would be able to catch this mistake thanks to case sensitivity.  Overall, while case sensitivity may seem unnecessary or even frustrating at times, it does serve a practical purpose in programming languages and can ultimately lead to more consistent and error-free code.",

But sooner or later, one needs to touch upon GUI-based programming, whether you want to or not. This transition holds many changes in how you need to think about the frontend (and possibly also the backend). So, what are the major differences when moving from console-based programming to GUI-based programming? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "1. User interaction: In console-based programming, input and output are text-based and mostly linear. GUI-based programming, on the other hand, allows for more complex and interactive user interfaces with buttons, sliders, menus, etc. This requires a different approach to how users interact with your program.  2. Event handling: In GUI programming, events such as button clicks or keyboard input play a crucial role in determining the flow of the program. Handling these events requires a different mindset compared to console-based programming where the program typically runs sequentially.  3. Layout and design: In GUI programming, the layout and design of the user interface become important factors. This includes considerations such as window sizes, control placement, and overall aesthetics. In console-based programming, the focus is more on the functionality rather than the visual appearance.  4. Multithreading: GUI programming often requires handling concurrent tasks such as user input, graphics rendering, and network communication. This can introduce complexities related to multithreading and synchronization that may not be as prevalent in console-based programming.  5. Resource management: GUI-based programming may involve managing additional resources such as images, icons, and fonts which need to be loaded and displayed efficiently. This requires a different approach to resource management compared to text-based programming.  Overall, transitioning from console-based programming to GUI-based programming involves a shift in mindset towards creating more interactive and visually appealing user interfaces while also dealing with the complexities of event-driven programming and resource management.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "The biggest difference is the design of the UI. A good GUI can make or break an application. Mac fans would draw attention to the beautifully designed GUI's of the average Mac OS X app and they've got a point, but this isn't a technology issue - it's a design/ethos/usability issue. As for technical issues, in no particular order:  The user can do anything they want in any order at any time, unlike console program in which you're either asking for input or telling them the output. You cannot assume that they'll follow the order you hope, unless you enforce the workflow Wizard-stylee. As already mentioned, events play a big part in this, and you can get multiple events happen while you're servicing the last one, so you can't really construct your state based on the 'current event'. Use closures or a similar mechanism to maintain context across different events. In a console app, your FSM is usually self-contained around the 'get input, process input, update output' loop. There isn't the same kind of structure in GUI programming - the 'main' is a re-entrant event-driven thing, often a ginormous switch() statement. You need to consider different screen sizes/resolutions and allow the GUI to resize from 800x600 up to the users' monitor maximum. You need to consider different input strategies - mouse, keyboard, touch, etc. Some technologies come for free (Mouse-wheel scrolling), others require some integration work (Ink). Accessibility - a GUI is much more suitable for less able users who have restricted vision, hearing, motor skills or cognitive skills. A 'ding' noise is nice and obvious compared to a cryptic error message on the console. Internationalization - i'm assuming your console app is US/ANSI only, but when you get into GUI, you can have language/resource packages that can target other languages and regions with no change to the coding, if you prepared for it from the start. For example, no hard-coded language strings in the code - everything as resource lookups. You have lots more options for implementation technology - web-based, various GUI kits, Flash/WPF, etc. Use of colour and animation. Console programs are generally monochromatic and don't animate much. Many modern GUI frameworks provide themed widgets and have move/size/show/hide animation effects, often for free. Graphics. Console apps sometimes use ASCII art for diagrams, but a GUI app gives you full graphical ability. Lovely art can make a big difference too.  ",

In Python: y = (x**2)**.5 x *= 2 assert y == abs(x)  will raise an exception, since x in the last line is not the same. Are there programming languages that use immutable variables? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Yes, there are programming languages that use immutable variables, meaning that once a value is assigned to a variable, that value cannot be changed. Functional programming languages such as Haskell, Elm, and Clojure follow this paradigm and use immutable variables. In these languages, variables are treated as constant values that cannot be reassigned new values. This can help prevent unintended side effects and make code easier to reason about.",

Right now, I'm taking \"Program Design.\" I should be learning how to organize my source code into functions and modules in order to make my programs readable and maintainable; instead, I'm learning about arrays and recursion in C. Next semester, I have to take \"Object-Oriented Design,\" which is taught through C++ (shudder.) Two years ago, I fell in love with programming, and I've been learning as much as I could since then. The prospect of taking another C++ class bores me almost to tears. For that reason, I thought I would start a programming club in order to meet similarly ambitious students, learn new languages, discuss software development topics, and work with other students developers.  However, I'm beginning to realize that there may not be any other students who share my software development experience. It's not because of a lack of motivation but a lack of opportunity: I know of only one other programming class (\"Programming Languages\") and no classes on real-world software development. Everybody else only has experience writing trivial scripts in C and C++. I've realized that if I want to work with other student software developers, I'm going to have to train them myself. Now, I'm planning to make the club a software development bootcamp, teaching members how to develop software with modern tools and languages. Obviously, starting an unofficial software development course is a monumental task with many possible approaches. My question to you, dear reader, is  What's my plan of attack? Should I  lecture the club myself, trying to balance club work with homework? ask the CS faculty to teach on topics within their expertise which may be less than relevant to members? try to find a sympathetic, experienced developer inside or outside the school who can share my workload? show video lectures (from MIT OpenCourseWare, Google Tech Talks, etc)? hold hands-on programming workshops? assign homework? do something else?

However, balancing club work with homework can be challenging, so make sure to manage your time effectively.  2. Ask the CS faculty to teach on topics within their expertise: This can be a good way to bring in expert knowledge and potentially expose members to new concepts. However, make sure that the topics are relevant and engaging for the club members.  3. Find a sympathetic, experienced developer: Having someone with real-world experience can be incredibly valuable to the club. They can provide practical insights and advice to the members. Just make sure they are willing to commit to helping out on a regular basis.  4. Show video lectures: Using resources like MIT OpenCourseWare or Google Tech Talks can be a great way to supplement your own lectures. This can provide additional perspectives and insights on the topics being covered.  5. Hold hands-on programming workshops: Hands-on workshops can be a great way to reinforce the concepts being taught and provide practical experience. Members can work on projects together and learn from each other.  6. Assign homework: Assigning homework can help members practice and reinforce their learning. It can also be a way to gauge their understanding of the material. Make sure the homework is challenging but achievable.  7. Do something else: Ultimately, the key is to be flexible and open to trying different approaches. Don't be afraid to experiment and see what works best for your club members.

        "ChatGpt answer": "There have been some studies and surveys conducted on the development speed and maintenance facility of different programming languages. However, the results can vary depending on the specific project, team, and individual developer skills.   One study conducted by Rebel Labs in 2014 compared the productivity of Java, Ruby, and Scala developers. The study found that Ruby developers were faster at writing code, but Java developers had fewer bugs and better performance. Scala developers were found to be the most productive overall.   Another survey conducted by Stack Overflow in 2017 asked developers about their preferred programming languages for productivity. The survey found that developers who used Python, JavaScript, and C# reported higher levels of productivity compared to those using languages like C and C++.   In terms of maintenance facility, dynamic languages like Python and Ruby are often considered easier to debug and maintain due to their flexible and forgiving syntax. Static languages like C, C++, and Java may require more strict coding practices to prevent bugs and errors. However, tools like IDEs and debugging tools can greatly improve the maintenance and debugging process for any language.   In conclusion, while there may not be a definitive answer to which language is the most productive or easiest to maintain, it ultimately depends on the specific project and the skills and preferences of the developers involved.

        "ChatGpt answer": "In functional programming, side effects are discouraged because they can make code harder to reason about and lead to unexpected behavior. Functional programming emphasizes immutability and the use of pure functions, which do not have side effects and always return the same output for a given input.   Side effects can also make code harder to test and debug, as they can introduce hidden dependencies and make it difficult to isolate and reproduce issues. Additionally, side effects can make it harder to parallelize or optimize code, as they introduce potential race conditions and make it more difficult to reason about the flow of data through a program.  By avoiding side effects, functional programming languages promote code that is more modular, composable, and maintainable. This can lead to more robust and reliable software, as well as easier collaboration among team members.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Writing your functions/methods without side effects - so they're pure functions - makes it easier to reason about the correctness of your program. It also makes it easy to compose those functions to create new behaviour. It also makes certain optimisations possible, where the compiler can for instance memoise the results of functions, or use Common Subexpression Elimination. Edit: at Benjol's request: Because a lot of your state's stored in the stack (data flow, not control flow, as Jonas has called it here), you can parallelise or otherwise reorder the execution of those parts of your computation that are independent of each other. You can easily find those independent parts because one part doesn't provide inputs to the other. In environments with debuggers that let you roll back the stack and resume computing (like Smalltalk), having pure functions means that you can very easily see how a value changes, because the previous states are available for inspection. In a mutation-heavy calculation, unless you explicitly add do/undo actions to your structure or algorithm, you cannot see the history of the computation.

Message Passing Inheritance Polymorphism Encapsulation  Or some other feature that you may like to introduce. Also I would like to know that what is the connection between Abstract Data type and Object Oriented programming? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One of the main features that has made object-oriented programming so successful is encapsulation. Encapsulation allows data to be hidden within objects and only accessible through methods defined within the object. This helps to protect data integrity and ensure that only the necessary operations can be performed on the data.  Another important feature is inheritance, which allows objects to inherit attributes and behavior from other objects, promoting code reusability and simplifying the creation of new classes.  Polymorphism is also a key feature that allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, allowing for flexibility and dynamic behavior at runtime.  Message passing is also important in object-oriented programming, as it allows objects to communicate with each other by sending messages.  The connection between Abstract Data Types (ADT) and object-oriented programming is that ADTs are typically implemented using classes in object-oriented programming. An ADT defines a set of data and operations on that data, without specifying how those operations are implemented. In object-oriented programming, classes can be used to define ADTs by encapsulating data and methods within the class. This allows for a clean separation of data and behavior, promoting modularity and code organization.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I'd suggest that the most important characteristic of object oriented programming is that of complexity management. The human brain can only hold so many concepts at one time - the oft quoted limit of remembering 7+/-2 independent items comes to mind. When I'm working on a 600kloc system at work, I can't hold the whole thing in my head at once. If I had to do that, I'd be limited to working on much smaller systems. Fortunately, I don't have to. The various design patterns and other structures that we've used on that project mean that I don't have to deal with the entire system at once - I can pick up individual pieces and work on them, knowing that they fit into the wider application in well defined ways. All of the important OO concepts provide ways to manage complexity. Encapsulation - let me deal with an external API that provides me with various services, without worrying how those services are implemented. Abstraction - let me concentrate on the essential characteristics and ignore what's not relevant. Composition - let me reuse components that have already been built in new combinations Polymorphism - let me ask for a service without worrying about how different objects might provide it in different ways. Inheritance - let me reuse an interface or an implementation, providing only the pieces that are different from what has gone before. Single Responsibility Principle - lets keep the purpose for each object clear and concise, so it's easy to reason about Liskov Substitution Prinicple - let's not lay traps for each other by introducing odd dependencies Open/Closed Principle - let's allow extension and modification in ways that don't require us to risk breaking existing code Dependency Injection - let's take composition to the next level and assemble the components together much later.

        "ChatGpt answer": "If we are solely considering performance and power in object-oriented languages, the ranking might look something like this:  1. C++: Known for its high performance, C++ is often used in resource-intensive applications such as games and high-frequency trading systems. It allows for low-level memory manipulation and efficient code execution.  2. Java: Java is a widely-used language in enterprise applications due to its platform independence and strong performance capabilities. It is known for its speed and reliability.  3. C#: Developed by Microsoft, C# is a powerful language with a focus on performance and ease of use. It is commonly used in game development and other performance-sensitive applications.  4. Python: While not traditionally known for its performance, Python has made significant strides in recent years with improvements like the PyPy JIT compiler. It is a versatile language used in a wide range of applications.  5. Ruby: Ruby is a dynamic and object-oriented language known for its ease of use and developer-friendly syntax. While not as performance-focused as some other languages, it can still be used effectively in many applications.  Of course, the best language for a particular project will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific requirements of the project, the skills of the development team, and the target platform. Ultimately, the choice of language should be based on a thorough evaluation of these criteria rather than just performance considerations alone.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Any time you care deeply about performance, you generally want to get as close to the metal as you can.  In most languages, you can write out performance critical segments in C code.  C programmers can drop down to assembly language for the really critical stuff.  So if I'm writing some C# code, but I really need a tight performance on an inner loop, I can write some C or C++ code and use interop to call that code.  If I need even more performance, I can write assembly in my C library.  Going lower than assembly is possible, but who wants to write machine code these days?   However, and this is the big consideration, dropping close to the metal is only high-performance for small, tight goals.  If I was writing a 3D renderer, I might do the floating point math and rendering in C, (using a library to execute it on the video card.)  But performance problems are also architectural, and performance issues from large-scale problems are often better solved in a high level language.   Look at Erlang: Ericsson needed a language to do massive parallel work easily, because doing parallel processing was going to get them way more performance than any tightly optimized C routines running on one CPU core.  Likewise, having the fastest code running in your loop is only performance enhancing if you can't remove the loop entirely by doing something better at the high level. You can do huge system, high level programming in C, but sometimes the greater expressiveness of a more powerful language will show opportunities for architectural optimizations that wouldn't be obvious otherwise.

        "ChatGpt answer": "As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, but I can provide some insights on this topic.   The use of English-based programming languages is indeed influenced by historical and economic factors, as well as the widespread use of English as a global language. English has also been shaped by technology and science, making it well-suited for programming due to its precision and clarity.  In terms of non-English programming languages, there are indeed examples like Plankalkul and the Russian-based flavor of Algol that you mentioned. These languages may have been influenced by the linguistic structure and characteristics of their respective languages, leading to differences in syntax and vocabulary compared to English-based languages.  Regarding Shakespeare's language, its richness and complexity could potentially offer new ways of expressing programming concepts. However, it is arguable whether using Shakespearean language would be practical or efficient for programming purposes.  Overall, the choice of programming language is often based on practical considerations such as readability, maintainability, and compatibility with existing software and systems. While exploring non-English programming languages can be interesting from a linguistic and cultural perspective, the dominance of English-based languages in the programming world is likely to continue due to its utility and convenience.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Disclaimer: My native language is German. I don't think there is any reason English as a language to take keywords from would be better than any other natural language. I do think it's the one all-important language in IT, but not because of linguistic properties, but because most tech people speak it to some degree, it's the native tounge of quite a few important people in the field, most tech-related terms are already English, etc. But since we talk about programming languages, not about documentation/API/names/etc, I have to object: Programming languages are not based on English - or on any other natural language, for that matter. Programming languages are formal languages. They do use, to varying degree, a handful of words from (usually) English. Some even try to mimic its grammar -- but utterly fail to read like English regardless. To add insult to injury, they only associate one single (in rare cases a handful of) meaning(s) with each word they borrow. Often, this meaning is very jargon-y, specialized, or based on a questionable analogy. Therefore, knowing the myriad natural-language meanings of a word borrowed by programming language doesn't really help understanding the programming concept behind the keyword. Examples off the top of my head: array, type, goto, class, void. (Fun fact that sprung to mind as I re-read the question: All of these, except goto, have German translations which are at most one character longer: Feld, Typ, Klasse, Leere. They all sound weird to me, but that's probably a matter of habit.) ",

        "ChatGpt answer": "As someone who has read both Code Complete and The Art of Computer Programming, I can tell you that they serve different purposes. Code Complete is more practical, focusing on specific techniques and best practices for writing clean, efficient code. It's a great resource for improving your coding skills and becoming a better programmer in a relatively short amount of time.  On the other hand, The Art of Computer Programming is a much more comprehensive and theoretical work. It delves into the mathematical foundations of algorithms and data structures, providing deep insights into the fundamental principles of computing. While it's definitely a valuable resource for anyone looking to become a truly expert programmer, it's also very dense and time-consuming to read.  In terms of professional development, I would recommend starting with Code Complete if you're looking for immediate practical benefits. Once you've mastered the concepts in Code Complete and have some extra time to dedicate to more theoretical study, then you might consider delving into The Art of Computer Programming.  In the meantime, working on pet projects or contributing to open source can also be valuable ways to improve your skills and gain real-world experience.

I was hoping that a F# success stories, or at least a few applications that I'd be familiar with might make it a little clearer about when F# (or any functional programming language) would be appropriate for a project. So back to the question, what are some well known applications that use F# or a similar functional programming language?

        "ChatGpt answer": "One well-known application that uses F# is the Halo 5: Guardians game developed by 343 Industries. F# was used for certain components of the game's AI system, as it allowed for rapid prototyping and easy parallelization of tasks.  Another example is Jet.com, an e-commerce website that uses F# for some of its backend services. F# was chosen for its ability to handle complex data transformations and calculations efficiently.  One lesser-known app that uses F# is Packet, a cloud infrastructure automation platform. F# was chosen for its strong type system and functional programming features, which helped improve code quality and maintainability.

However, the overwhelming majority of applications are not \"well-known\". There is only one PowerPoint, but there are literally millions of hand-written custom little one-off in-house payroll apps. And F# is certainly used in-house in many financial companies, doing scientific and numeric computing in, say, biotech or greentech, doing statistics god knows where and so on. These applications aren't well-known, either because they simply aren't \"sexy\" or often because the companies consider F# their secret weapon which gives them a competitive edge.

        "ChatGpt answer": "Hello Gorgen,  It's great to hear about your programming journey and your interest in relearning C. Here are some recommendations to help you get started:  Compiler, Debugger, IDE: For C programming, you can use popular IDEs such as Visual Studio, Eclipse, or Code::Blocks. As for compilers, you can use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Clang for C programming. For debugging, you can use GDB (GNU Debugger) or LLDB.  Libraries for C: There are many libraries available for C programming that you can use to enhance your code. Some popular libraries for C include SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) for graphics and multimedia, libcurl for network communication, and zlib for data compression. You can also find libraries on websites like GitHub, SourceForge, or searching online for specific functionalities you need.  Source for procedural programming patterns and best practices: To learn about procedural programming patterns and best practices in C, you can refer to books like \"The C Programming Language\" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, \"C Programming: A Modern Approach\" by K. N. King, or online resources like tutorials and documentation from reputable sources like the GNU website or C programming communities.  Where to find good code to learn from: You can find good code examples and projects to learn from on websites like GitHub, Bitbucket, or SourceForge. You can search for projects specifically in C or look for open-source projects that interest you. Reading and understanding code written by experienced developers can help you learn new techniques and best practices.  I hope this information helps you in your journey to relearn C programming.

        "Question": "Similar question was closed on SO. Sometimes when we're programming, we find that some particular control structure would be very useful to us, but is not directly available in our programming language. What alternative control structures do you think are a useful way of organizing computation? The goal here is to get new ways of thinking about structuring code, in order to improve chunking and reasoning. You can create a wishful syntax/semantic not available now or cite a less known control structure on an existent programming language. Answers should give ideas for a new programming language or enhancing an actual language. Think of this as brainstorming, so post something you think is a crazy idea but it can be viable in some scenario. It's about imperative programming. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One alternative control structure that I find very powerful is the concept of coroutines. Coroutines allow for cooperative multitasking within a single thread, allowing for more efficient and responsive code. By implementing coroutines, we can easily pause and resume execution at specific points in our code, which can be very useful in certain scenarios such as event-driven programming or managing asynchronous tasks.  Another interesting control structure is the concept of continuations. Continuations allow for capturing the current state of a computation and being able to resume it at a later point in time. This can be used to implement powerful control flow constructs such as backtracking, error handling, and even implementing new control structures on top of an existing programming language.  Lastly, I think the idea of declarative control structures, such as logic programming or reactive programming, can also be very useful in organizing computation in a different way. By expressing computation in terms of relationships between variables or in terms of streams of data, we can achieve a more concise and potentially more maintainable codebase. This can be particularly useful for handling complex business logic or dealing with real-time data processing.  Overall, there are many alternative control structures that can be explored to improve the organization and reasoning of code. It's important to think outside the box and consider how different paradigms and concepts can be leveraged to enhance the capabilities of our programming languages.",

Python is a versatile language and widely used in web development, data science, and more. It will help him grasp the basic concepts of programming.  2. Move on to theory: Once he has a basic understanding of a programming language, he can start learning fundamental concepts such as algorithms, data structures, and design patterns. This will give him a deeper understanding of how to write efficient and maintainable code.  3. Learn markup languages and web development: As he is interested in web programming, he should learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are essential languages for front-end web development. He can then move on to frameworks such as React or Angular for more advanced web development.  4. Explore back-end development: To build full-fledged web applications, he will need to learn a back-end programming language like Ruby or PHP. He can also consider learning Node.js, which uses JavaScript for server-side development.  5. Practice and build projects: Encourage him to work on small projects to apply his knowledge and skills. Building projects will help him reinforce what he has learned and gain practical experience.  In terms of books, here are some recommendations:  - \"Python Crash Course\" by Eric Matthes - \"Introduction to Algorithms\" by Thomas Cormen et al. - \"Eloquent JavaScript\" by Marijn Haverbeke - \"HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites\" by Jon Duckett - \"Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript\" by Robin Nixon  Remember, everyone learns differently, so encourage him to experiment with different resources and find what works best for him.
