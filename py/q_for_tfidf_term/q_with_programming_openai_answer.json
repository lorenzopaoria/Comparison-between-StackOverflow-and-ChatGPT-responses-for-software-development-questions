        "Question": "During my four years at university we have been using much functional programming in several functional programming languages. But I have also used much object oriented programming to, and in fact I use object oriented languages more when doing my own small project to prepare for my first job. But I often wish that I was coding in a functional programming language when doing these projects. However, when looking for a job, it is very rare to see a job where knowledge of a functional programming language is required. Why isn't functional programming languages used more in the industry? There is quite much news about functional programming languages these days, so I wonder if functional programming is catching on in the industry now? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are a few reasons why functional programming languages may not be as widely used in industry compared to object-oriented languages.  Firstly, functional programming languages can have a steeper learning curve for those who are used to imperative or object-oriented programming. This can make it harder for companies to find developers who are proficient in functional programming languages, leading them to stick with more mainstream languages.  Additionally, many companies have existing codebases written in object-oriented languages, making it easier to continue using those languages rather than transitioning to functional programming languages.  However, there has been a growing interest in functional programming in recent years, with languages like Haskell, Clojure, and Scala gaining popularity. Many companies are starting to see the benefits of functional programming, such as improved code maintainability, scalability, and parallelism.  In conclusion, while functional programming may not be as widely used in industry compared to object-oriented programming, there is a growing interest and adoption of functional programming languages in the tech industry. It is possible that we may see an increase in demand for developers with knowledge of functional programming in the coming years.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I would say that one of the reasons that functional programming is not more prevalent is the lack of knowledge base.  My experience is that corporations are very risk averse in terms of implementing technologies that are not main stream and would rather invest in tried and true frameworks (java, c++, c#).  It's only when there is a business need (like in Ericsson) that new paradigms are considered.  But even in Ericsson's case I heard that management demanded that c++ be used and Joe Armstrong was compelled to code erlang calls in c++!! This should show how reluctant corporations are to implement new technologies! ",

        "Question": "No matter how much you love a programming language, there are always a few details in it that aren\u2019t quite as nice as they could be. In this question, I would like to specifically focus on syntax elements. In a programming language that you use frequently (perhaps your favourite programming language, or perhaps the one you are forced to use at work), which syntax element do you find most unreadable, unclear, inconvenient or unpleasant? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One syntax element that I find most unpleasant in the programming language I use frequently is the curly braces for defining blocks of code. While curly braces are a common syntax element in many programming languages, I find that they can make the code harder to read and maintain, especially when dealing with nested blocks of code.  I often find myself spending extra time ensuring that the curly braces are properly matched and aligned, which can be a tedious and error-prone task. Additionally, I find that the use of curly braces can sometimes clutter the code and make it harder to quickly identify the beginning and end of a block.  Overall, I find that alternative syntax elements such as indentation-based block delimiters (like in Python) or keyword-based block delimiters (like in Ruby) can be more readable and intuitive. I believe that using a syntax element that is more visually clear and concise can greatly improve the readability and maintainability of code.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Semicolon insertion in JavaScript. I haven't really been bitten by it often, but it's just such a phenomenally bad idea it makes my head spin.  Here's the rules (from ECMA-262 Section 7.9)  When the program contains a token that is not allowed by the formal grammar, then a semicolon is inserted if (a) there is a line break at that point, or (b) the unexpected token was a closing brace. When the end of a file is reached, if the program cannot be parsed otherwise, then a semicolon is inserted. When a \"restricted production\" is encountered and contains a line terminator in a place where the grammar contains the annotation \"[no LineTerminator here]\", then a semicolon is inserted.    Example: return 1; // returns 1  return 1; // returns undefined  ",

        "Question": "When learning a new programming language you sometimes come across a language feature which  makes you wish you had it in your other programming languages that you know. What are some language feature which were at the time of learning very new to you and that you wish your other programming languages had.   An example of this is generators in Python or C#. Other examples may include list comprehensions in Python, template in C++ or LINQ in .NET or lazy evaluation in Haskell. What other semi-unique language features have you come across which were completely new and enlightening to you?  Are there other features of older programming languages which were unique and have fallen out of fashion? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One language feature that I found very new and interesting when I first learned it was pattern matching in Rust. Pattern matching allows for concise and readable code when dealing with complex data structures or enumerations. It can help to simplify control flow and make code more maintainable.  Another language feature that I wish more languages had is algebraic data types, which are common in functional programming languages like Haskell. These types allow for more precise modeling of data and can help to prevent runtime errors by enforcing stricter type checking.  In terms of older language features that have fallen out of fashion, one example could be explicit memory management through pointers in languages like C and C++. With the advent of more modern programming languages that handle memory management automatically, the need for explicit memory management has decreased. However, understanding how memory management works at a lower level can still be beneficial for certain types of programming tasks.",

Yes - the big scary word that makes increadibly easy parsers, IO, operations on Lists and other things so easy (once you notice common pattern) Arrows.

        "Question": "Sometimes, one creates a exploratory prototype and forgets about structure in the directories... What are good tips on dividing the programming files over (several levels of) directories? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "1. Start by grouping related files together: Create separate directories for different types of files such as controllers, models, views, stylesheets, scripts, and assets.  2. Keep it organized: Make sure to name your directories and files in a clear and logical way that reflects their purpose and content.  3. Use subdirectories for deeper organization: If your project is large and has multiple layers of functionality, consider creating subdirectories within your main directories to further organize your files.  4. Separate third-party code: If you are using third-party libraries or plugins, consider creating a separate directory for them to keep your codebase clean and distinguish them from your own code.  5. Keep your directory structure consistent: Once you have established a directory structure, stick to it throughout your project to avoid confusion and make it easier to navigate your codebase.  6. Utilize version control: Use a version control system like Git to keep track of changes to your codebase and easily revert back to previous versions if needed.  7. Document your directory structure: It's a good idea to create a README file or documentation that explains the purpose of each directory and how they are organized. This can help new developers quickly understand your project's structure.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "If your language is OOP and package based (Eg Java), then you should probably keep each package in its own folder (eg my/package/name) to keep with the convention. If your language isn't package based (Eg PHP), then organize by what each file does. Here's an example  Does this do utility functions? Goes in /util Is this a 3rd party plugin? Goes in /plugin Is this part of the admin panel? Goes in /admin, along with ALL supporting files Is this Javascript? Goes in /javascript Is this CSS? Goes in /css Is this a template? Goes in /templates/templateName etc  Language agnostic, Most people have a /src directory for all source files, a /lib directory for libraries, and a /bin or /dist directory for builds.  ",
