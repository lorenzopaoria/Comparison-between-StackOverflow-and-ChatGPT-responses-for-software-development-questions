        "Question": "During my four years at university we have been using much functional programming in several functional programming languages. But I have also used much object oriented programming to, and in fact I use object oriented languages more when doing my own small project to prepare for my first job. But I often wish that I was coding in a functional programming language when doing these projects. However, when looking for a job, it is very rare to see a job where knowledge of a functional programming language is required. Why isn't functional programming languages used more in the industry? There is quite much news about functional programming languages these days, so I wonder if functional programming is catching on in the industry now? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Functional programming has been gaining popularity in recent years due to its focus on immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions, which can lead to more robust, efficient, and maintainable code. However, object-oriented programming has been the dominant paradigm in the industry for decades, and many companies have existing codebases and systems built using object-oriented languages.  Despite the advantages of functional programming, there are still challenges in adopting it in industry. Functional programming can require a shift in mindset and a different approach to problem-solving compared to object-oriented programming. Additionally, there may be a lack of expertise in functional programming languages among developers, making it harder for companies to find qualified candidates with the necessary skills.  That being said, there are companies that have successfully adopted functional programming languages, such as Scala, Clojure, or Haskell, in their tech stacks. These companies often cite benefits such as improved code quality, easier concurrency and parallelism, and better scalability.  As the tech industry continues to evolve, there may be more opportunities for functional programming to gain traction in the industry. With the increasing demand for scalable, reliable, and maintainable software, functional programming languages may become more prevalent in the future. It's always beneficial for developers to have experience with multiple programming paradigms, so continuing to learn and explore functional programming can only enhance your skillset and make you a more well-rounded developer.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I would say that one of the reasons that functional programming is not more prevalent is the lack of knowledge base.  My experience is that corporations are very risk averse in terms of implementing technologies that are not main stream and would rather invest in tried and true frameworks (java, c++, c#).  It's only when there is a business need (like in Ericsson) that new paradigms are considered.  But even in Ericsson's case I heard that management demanded that c++ be used and Joe Armstrong was compelled to code erlang calls in c++!! This should show how reluctant corporations are to implement new technologies! ",

        "Question": "No matter how much you love a programming language, there are always a few details in it that aren\u2019t quite as nice as they could be. In this question, I would like to specifically focus on syntax elements. In a programming language that you use frequently (perhaps your favourite programming language, or perhaps the one you are forced to use at work), which syntax element do you find most unreadable, unclear, inconvenient or unpleasant? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One syntax element that I find quite unpleasant in the programming language I use frequently (Java) is the verbosity of writing getter and setter methods for class fields. While I understand the importance of encapsulation and data hiding, having to write out boilerplate code for each field in a class can become quite tedious and clutter the codebase.  For example, having to write out something like this for every field:  ```java private String name;  public String getName() {     return name; }  public void setName(String name) {     this.name = name; } ```  It would be much more convenient if Java had a built-in shorthand for generating these methods, similar to how frameworks like Lombok provide annotations to automatically generate getters and setters. This would definitely make the code cleaner and more concise.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Semicolon insertion in JavaScript. I haven't really been bitten by it often, but it's just such a phenomenally bad idea it makes my head spin.  Here's the rules (from ECMA-262 Section 7.9)  When the program contains a token that is not allowed by the formal grammar, then a semicolon is inserted if (a) there is a line break at that point, or (b) the unexpected token was a closing brace. When the end of a file is reached, if the program cannot be parsed otherwise, then a semicolon is inserted. When a \"restricted production\" is encountered and contains a line terminator in a place where the grammar contains the annotation \"[no LineTerminator here]\", then a semicolon is inserted.    Example: return 1; // returns 1  return 1; // returns undefined  ",

        "Question": "When learning a new programming language you sometimes come across a language feature which  makes you wish you had it in your other programming languages that you know. What are some language feature which were at the time of learning very new to you and that you wish your other programming languages had.   An example of this is generators in Python or C#. Other examples may include list comprehensions in Python, template in C++ or LINQ in .NET or lazy evaluation in Haskell. What other semi-unique language features have you come across which were completely new and enlightening to you?  Are there other features of older programming languages which were unique and have fallen out of fashion? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One new and enlightening language feature for me was pattern matching in languages like Elixir and Rust. Pattern matching allows for elegant and concise code, especially when working with complex data structures.  Another feature that I found highly useful was type inference in languages like Scala and F#. Type inference helps reduce the amount of boilerplate code required, while still providing strong static typing benefits.  A feature that has fallen out of fashion but still holds some value is operator overloading, popular in languages like C++ and Ada. Operator overloading allows developers to define custom behaviors for operators, making code more expressive and concise. However, it can lead to confusion and misuse if not applied carefully.  Overall, new language features can greatly enhance the developer experience and productivity, while older features may still have their place in certain contexts. It's always valuable to explore and learn from different programming languages to broaden our understanding and skills.",

Yes - the big scary word that makes increadibly easy parsers, IO, operations on Lists and other things so easy (once you notice common pattern) Arrows.

        "Question": "Sometimes, one creates a exploratory prototype and forgets about structure in the directories... What are good tips on dividing the programming files over (several levels of) directories? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Here are some tips for organizing your programming files into directories:  1. Group related files together: Put files that are related to each other in the same directory. For example, place all of the files for a specific module or feature in a single directory.  2. Use subdirectories to organize files further: If you have a large number of files, consider creating subdirectories within your main directory to further organize your files. For example, you could have a \"models\" directory for all of your data models, a \"controllers\" directory for all of your controller files, and so on.  3. Use meaningful names for directories: Make sure your directory names are descriptive and easy to understand. This will make it easier for you and others to navigate through your project.  4. Avoid nesting too many levels deep: While subdirectories can be helpful for organizing your files, be cautious of creating too many levels of nesting. This can make it difficult to navigate and find specific files.  5. Keep your directory structure consistent: Establish a consistent naming convention and structure for your directories and stick to it. This will make it easier for you and others to understand and work with your project.  6. Use version control: Consider using a version control system like Git to track changes to your project and manage your directory structure. This will make it easier to collaborate with others and keep track of changes over time.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "If your language is OOP and package based (Eg Java), then you should probably keep each package in its own folder (eg my/package/name) to keep with the convention. If your language isn't package based (Eg PHP), then organize by what each file does. Here's an example  Does this do utility functions? Goes in /util Is this a 3rd party plugin? Goes in /plugin Is this part of the admin panel? Goes in /admin, along with ALL supporting files Is this Javascript? Goes in /javascript Is this CSS? Goes in /css Is this a template? Goes in /templates/templateName etc  Language agnostic, Most people have a /src directory for all source files, a /lib directory for libraries, and a /bin or /dist directory for builds.  ",
