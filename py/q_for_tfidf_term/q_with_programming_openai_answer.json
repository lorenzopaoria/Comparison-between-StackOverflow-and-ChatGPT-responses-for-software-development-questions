        "Question": "During my four years at university we have been using much functional programming in several functional programming languages. But I have also used much object oriented programming to, and in fact I use object oriented languages more when doing my own small project to prepare for my first job. But I often wish that I was coding in a functional programming language when doing these projects. However, when looking for a job, it is very rare to see a job where knowledge of a functional programming language is required. Why isn't functional programming languages used more in the industry? There is quite much news about functional programming languages these days, so I wonder if functional programming is catching on in the industry now? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Functional programming languages have been gaining popularity in recent years due to their ability to simplify code, increase scalability, and improve code maintainability. However, traditional object-oriented programming languages such as Java and C++ still dominate the industry due to their widespread use and familiarity among developers.  One reason for the slow adoption of functional programming in industry is the lack of developers with expertise in functional programming languages. Many developers are more familiar with object-oriented languages and may not be as comfortable or experienced with functional programming paradigms.  Additionally, functional programming languages can have a steeper learning curve for developers who are used to object-oriented languages. The shift in mindset required to understand functional programming concepts such as immutability and higher-order functions may deter some developers from exploring functional programming languages.  Despite these challenges, there are industries and companies that are embracing functional programming languages for their projects. Companies in industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce are increasingly turning to functional programming languages like Haskell, Scala, and Clojure for their ability to handle complex and data-intensive applications.  As the benefits of functional programming become more widely recognized, it is likely that the industry will see an increase in the adoption of functional programming languages. Developers who have experience with both functional and object-oriented programming paradigms will be well-positioned to take advantage of this shift in the industry.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I would say that one of the reasons that functional programming is not more prevalent is the lack of knowledge base.  My experience is that corporations are very risk averse in terms of implementing technologies that are not main stream and would rather invest in tried and true frameworks (java, c++, c#).  It's only when there is a business need (like in Ericsson) that new paradigms are considered.  But even in Ericsson's case I heard that management demanded that c++ be used and Joe Armstrong was compelled to code erlang calls in c++!! This should show how reluctant corporations are to implement new technologies! ",

        "Question": "No matter how much you love a programming language, there are always a few details in it that aren\u2019t quite as nice as they could be. In this question, I would like to specifically focus on syntax elements. In a programming language that you use frequently (perhaps your favourite programming language, or perhaps the one you are forced to use at work), which syntax element do you find most unreadable, unclear, inconvenient or unpleasant? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One syntax element that I find particularly cumbersome in Python, which is a language I use frequently, is list comprehensions. While they can be extremely powerful and concise, they can also become difficult to understand and maintain, especially when nested or when used in complex expressions. The syntax, with its mix of brackets, colons, and for loops, can quickly become unreadable and confusing, making it hard to debug and interpret code that heavily relies on list comprehensions.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Semicolon insertion in JavaScript. I haven't really been bitten by it often, but it's just such a phenomenally bad idea it makes my head spin.  Here's the rules (from ECMA-262 Section 7.9)  When the program contains a token that is not allowed by the formal grammar, then a semicolon is inserted if (a) there is a line break at that point, or (b) the unexpected token was a closing brace. When the end of a file is reached, if the program cannot be parsed otherwise, then a semicolon is inserted. When a \"restricted production\" is encountered and contains a line terminator in a place where the grammar contains the annotation \"[no LineTerminator here]\", then a semicolon is inserted.    Example: return 1; // returns 1  return 1; // returns undefined  ",

        "Question": "When learning a new programming language you sometimes come across a language feature which  makes you wish you had it in your other programming languages that you know. What are some language feature which were at the time of learning very new to you and that you wish your other programming languages had.   An example of this is generators in Python or C#. Other examples may include list comprehensions in Python, template in C++ or LINQ in .NET or lazy evaluation in Haskell. What other semi-unique language features have you come across which were completely new and enlightening to you?  Are there other features of older programming languages which were unique and have fallen out of fashion? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One language feature that I found very new and useful when learning Scala was pattern matching. Pattern matching allows you to match complex patterns in data structures, making it easier to write concise and readable code. This is something that I wish my other languages had, as it can greatly simplify certain tasks.  Another language feature that I found fascinating and wished other languages had was the concept of immutability in functional languages like Clojure. In Clojure, data structures are immutable by default, which can help prevent bugs related to mutable state. This approach to data manipulation was quite new to me and I found it to be very powerful.  In terms of older language features that have fallen out of fashion, one example that comes to mind is the use of goto statements in languages like C and BASIC. While goto statements can be useful in certain situations, they can also make code harder to read and maintain. As a result, most modern languages have abandoned the use of goto in favor of more structured control flow mechanisms like loops and functions.  Overall, exploring different programming languages and their unique features can be a valuable learning experience, and can help broaden your perspective on software development.",

Yes - the big scary word that makes increadibly easy parsers, IO, operations on Lists and other things so easy (once you notice common pattern) Arrows.

        "Question": "Sometimes, one creates a exploratory prototype and forgets about structure in the directories... What are good tips on dividing the programming files over (several levels of) directories? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "1. Group related files together: Make sure that files that are closely related to each other are placed in the same directory. This will make it easier to find and work with these files when making updates or modifications.  2. Use a logical and consistent naming convention: Use clear and descriptive names for your directories that are easy to understand and follow. This will help you and other developers quickly locate files when needed.  3. Create subdirectories for each module or component: Divide your project into distinct modules or components and create separate directories for each one. This will help keep your code organized and make it easier to navigate through your project.  4. Keep directory depth to a minimum: Try to keep your directory structure as flat as possible to avoid creating too many levels of directories. This will make it easier to navigate through your project and reduce the risk of getting lost in a complex directory structure.  5. Avoid redundancy: Do not duplicate files or directories unnecessarily. Keep your project structure as clean and streamlined as possible to avoid confusion and save disk space.  6. Use version control: Use a version control system like Git to track changes to your project and ensure that you can easily revert back to previous versions if needed. This will also help you keep track of changes made to your directory structure over time.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "If your language is OOP and package based (Eg Java), then you should probably keep each package in its own folder (eg my/package/name) to keep with the convention. If your language isn't package based (Eg PHP), then organize by what each file does. Here's an example  Does this do utility functions? Goes in /util Is this a 3rd party plugin? Goes in /plugin Is this part of the admin panel? Goes in /admin, along with ALL supporting files Is this Javascript? Goes in /javascript Is this CSS? Goes in /css Is this a template? Goes in /templates/templateName etc  Language agnostic, Most people have a /src directory for all source files, a /lib directory for libraries, and a /bin or /dist directory for builds.  ",
