        "Question": "During my four years at university we have been using much functional programming in several functional programming languages. But I have also used much object oriented programming to, and in fact I use object oriented languages more when doing my own small project to prepare for my first job. But I often wish that I was coding in a functional programming language when doing these projects. However, when looking for a job, it is very rare to see a job where knowledge of a functional programming language is required. Why isn't functional programming languages used more in the industry? There is quite much news about functional programming languages these days, so I wonder if functional programming is catching on in the industry now? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Functional programming has been gaining popularity in recent years due to its ability to handle complex problems with simplicity and efficiency. However, the industry has been slow to adopt functional programming languages for several reasons.  One reason is that many companies already have a large codebase written in object-oriented languages like Java or C++, and it can be difficult and costly to switch to a new programming paradigm. Additionally, functional programming languages may not be as well-known or widely used as object-oriented languages, making it harder for companies to find developers with the necessary skills.  Another reason for the slow adoption of functional programming languages in the industry is that they can be seen as more difficult to learn and understand compared to object-oriented languages. This can make it harder for companies to train their existing developers or hire new developers who are proficient in functional programming.  Despite these challenges, there is a growing interest in functional programming in the industry, especially in areas such as data science, machine learning, and distributed systems. Companies are starting to realize the benefits of functional programming, such as better scalability, easier debugging, and improved code quality.  As the demand for functional programming skills continues to grow, it is likely that more companies will start to incorporate functional programming languages into their development stack. So, while functional programming may not be as prevalent in the industry as object-oriented programming, it is definitely a trend that is catching on.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I was a professor and, just like programmers, professors are always looking for the Next Big Thing. When they think they've found one, they make it a bandwagon, and everyone piles on. Since they are preaching to students who think professors must be really smart, else why would they be professors, they get no resistance. Functional programming is such a bandwagon. Sure it's got lots of nice interesting questions to investigate, and lots of sort-of-interesting conference articles to write. It's not a particularly new idea, and you can do it in just about any modern language, and ideas don't have to be new to be interesting. It's also a good skill to have. Given that, functional programming is just one arrow to have in your quiver, not the only one, just as OOP is not the only one. My beef with computer science academia is lack of practical interplay with industry to determine what actually makes real-world sense, i.e. quality control. If that quality control were there, there might be a different emphasis, on classifying problems and the ranges of solutions to them, with tradeoffs, rather than just the latest bandwagons. ",

Some examples include \"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship\" by Robert C. Martin, \"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software\" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, and \"The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas.

What are some language feature which were at the time of learning very new to you and that you wish your other programming languages had.   An example of this is generators in Python or C#. Other examples may include list comprehensions in Python, template in C++ or LINQ in .NET or lazy evaluation in Haskell. What other semi-unique language features have you come across which were completely new and enlightening to you?  Are there other features of older programming languages which were unique and have fallen out of fashion? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Some other unique language features that I have come across and found to be very useful include:  1. Pattern matching in languages like Rust and Elixir, which allow for more concise and readable code when working with complex data structures.  2. Optional and nullable types in languages like Swift and Kotlin, which make it easier to handle null values and prevent null pointer exceptions.  3. Type inference in languages like Scala and Kotlin, which allows the compiler to automatically deduce the type of a variable based on its usage, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.  4. Higher-order functions and lambdas in languages like Clojure and JavaScript, which enable functional programming paradigms and make it easier to work with collections and perform operations on them.  As for older language features that have fallen out of fashion, some examples include:  1. GOTO statements, which were widely used in earlier languages like BASIC and Fortran but are now generally considered to be harmful to code readability and maintainability.  2. Manual memory management, which was common in languages like C and C++ but is now largely replaced by automatic memory management techniques like garbage collection and smart pointers.  3. Explicit type declarations for variables, which were necessary in languages like C and Pascal but are now seen as unnecessary boilerplate in languages with type inference capabilities.  Overall, programming languages continue to evolve and incorporate new features and paradigms, with older features that are considered outdated or problematic being phased out in favor of more modern and efficient alternatives.",

        "Question": "Literate programming has good ideals. Why do you think that this isn't mainstream? It is because it has failed to deliver? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There could be various reasons why literate programming is not mainstream. One reason could be that it requires a different mindset and approach to programming, which may be challenging for developers who are used to more traditional methods. Additionally, the tools and infrastructure needed to support literate programming may not be as readily available or as user-friendly as other programming practices.  It is also possible that literate programming has not gained widespread adoption because it has not been effectively marketed or promoted to the programming community. Without strong advocacy and support from influential figures or organizations, new programming paradigms can struggle to gain traction.  It is important to note that the perceived lack of mainstream adoption does not necessarily mean that literate programming has failed to deliver on its promises. It may simply mean that it has not yet reached a critical mass of adoption and recognition within the programming community. As with any new approach to programming, it may take time for literate programming to gain acceptance and become more widely adopted.",

Then I tried to use the literary programming display to comprehend what was going on in the program, and found it harder than it looked.  It may have been that I was too used to going through program listings, but it seemed confusing. Then I looked at the source code, and that turned me off then and there.  I'd have to learn to write programs in an entirely new way, with less correspondence between the program text and what the compiler saw, and saw no corresponding benefit. In addition, people can write long and convincing arguments that the code is doing X when it's actually doing Y, and I've run into my share of misleading comments.  I developed a fondness for reading the code to see what it's doing fairly early.  Literate programming is the antithesis of that. ",

You can of course talk about programming with other programmers, and there is peer programming, and you do get to create something that you can show to people, but when it comes to explaining to non programmers what is it that you do, or how was your day at work, it's sort of tricky.

You can also try to explain the problem-solving aspect of programming. Many people can relate to the idea of solving puzzles or coming up with creative solutions to challenges, so highlighting this aspect of programming can make it more relatable.

        "ChatGpt answer": "Creating a universal programming language that combines the best features of all existing languages may sound like a great idea in theory, but in practice, it would be extremely challenging to achieve. Here are a few reasons why:  1. Different programming languages have been developed to address specific needs and requirements. Combining all these features into one language could potentially lead to a bloated and overly complex language that is difficult to use and understand.  2. Each programming language has its own syntax, semantics, and paradigms, making it difficult to seamlessly integrate all of these into one cohesive language.  3. Trying to incorporate all the features of existing languages could lead to conflicts and inconsistencies in the design of the universal language.  4. Developers may have different preferences and expertise in different programming languages, making it difficult for them to adapt to a completely new and unfamiliar programming language.  Ultimately, it may be more effective to leverage the strengths of existing programming languages and use them in combination with each other, rather than trying to create a one-size-fits-all solution. This approach allows developers to choose the most appropriate language for each specific task and leverage the rich ecosystem of tools and resources available for each individual language.",

After placing a link to the blog in a comment on Programmers.SE someone requested that I post a question here so that they could answer it.  This posting is my most popular, as people seem to type \"I don't get object-oriented programming\" into Google a lot.  Feel free to answer here, or in a comment at Wordpress.  What is object-oriented programming?    No one has given me a satisfactory   answer.  I feel like you will not get   a good definition from someone who   goes around saying \u201cobject\u201d and   \u201cobject-oriented\u201d with his nose in the   air. Nor will you get a good   definition from someone who has done   nothing but object-oriented   programming. No one who understands   both procedural and object-oriented   programming has ever given me a   consistent idea of what an   object-oriented program actually does.  Can someone please give me their ideas of the advantages of object-oriented programming? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One advantage of object-oriented programming is that it allows for better organization and structure in a program. By breaking down a program into objects that represent real-world entities, it becomes easier to manage and modify the code. Additionally, object-oriented programming promotes code reusability, as objects can be reused in different parts of the program or in different programs altogether. This can help save time and reduce errors in coding. Another advantage is that object-oriented programming promotes encapsulation, which means that the internal workings of an object are hidden from the outside world. This can help improve security and prevent unintended changes to the code. Overall, object-oriented programming can lead to more modular, maintainable, and scalable code.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "From your blog, it seems that you're familiar with both imperative and functional programming, and that you're familiar with the basic concepts involved in object-oriented programming, but you've just never really had it \"click\" as to what makes it useful.  I'll try to explain in terms of that knowledge, and hope that it's helpful to you. At its core, OOP is a way to use the imperative paradigm to better manage high degrees of complexity by creating \"smart\" data structures that model the problem domain.  In a (standard procedural non-object-oriented) program, you've got two basic things: variables, and code that knows what to do with them.  The code takes input from the user and various other sources, stores it in variables, operates on it, and produces output data which goes to the user or various other locations. Object-oriented programming is a way to simplify your program by taking that basic pattern and repeating it on a smaller scale.  Just like a program is a large collection of data with code that knows what to do with it, each object is a small piece of data bound to code that knows what to do with it. By breaking down the problem domain into smaller pieces and making sure as much data as possible is bound directly to code that knows what to do with it, you make it a lot easier to reason about the process as a whole and also about the sub-issues that make up the process. By grouping data into object classes, you can centralize code related to that data, making relevant code easier both to find and to debug.  And by encapsulating the data behind access specifiers and only accessing it through methods, (or properties, if your language supports them,) you greatly reduce the potential for data corruption or the violation of invariants. And by using inheritance and polymorphism, you can reuse preexisting classes, customizing them to fit your specific needs, without having to either modify the originals or rewrite everything from the ground up.  (Which is a thing you should never do, if you can avoid it.)  Just be careful you understand your base object, or you could end up with killer kangaroos. To me, these are the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming: complexity management, code centralization and improved problem-domain modeling through the creation of object classes, inheritance and polymorphism, and increased safety without sacrificing power or control through the use of encapsulation and properties.  I hope this helps you understand why so many programmers find it useful. EDIT: In response to Joel's question in the comments,  Can you explain what an \"object-oriented program\" contains   (other than these fancy defintions you've outlined) that is fundamentally   different from an imperative program? How do you \"get the ball rolling?\"  A little disclaimer here.  My model of \"an object-oriented program\" is basically the Delphi model, which is very similar to the C#/.NET model since they were created by former Delphi team members.  What I'm saying here may not apply, or not apply as much, in other OO languages. An object-oriented program is one in which all the logic is structured around objects.  Of course this has to be bootstrapped somewhere.  Your typical Delphi program contains initialization code that creates a singleton object called Application.  At the start of the program, it calls Application.Initialize, then a call to Application.CreateForm for every form you want to load into memory from the beginning, and then Application.Run, which displays the main form on screen and starts up the input/event loop that forms the core of any interactive computer programs. Application and your forms poll for incoming events from the OS and translate them into method calls on your object.  One thing that's very common is the use of event handlers, or \"delegates\" in .NET-speak.  An object has a method that says, \"do X and Y, but also check to see if this particular event handler is assigned, and call it if it is.\"  An event handler is a method pointer--a very simple closure that contains a reference to the method and a reference to the object instance--that's used to extend the behavior of objects.  For example, if I have a button object on my form, I customize its behavior by attaching an OnClick event handler, which causes some other object to execute a method when the button is clicked. So in an object-oriented program, most of the work gets done by defining objects with certain responsibilities and linking them together, either through method pointers or by one object directly calling a method defined in another object's public interface.  (And now we're back to encapsulation.)  This is an idea that I had no concept of back before I took OOP classes in college. ",

        "Question": "Linguistic relativity is the idea that language shapes the way we think.  My question is, how much, and to what extent, does this apply to programming?  Are some native, natural languages better-suited for thinking about programming than others?  For instance, can the following be stated more concisely in a non-English language?  Select a pivot.  Move all the items less than the pivot to one side of the list, and all the items greater than the pivot to the other side. Does a Chinese-speaking programmer view programming in a radically different lens than an English-speaking programmer, or do the differences fade away when both are immersed in the subject? Are some programming languages and domains easier to think about in one language or another.  For instance, is it any easier to grok Ruby if you are Japanese because the creator of Ruby is Japanese?  Note that this question is not focused on \"how do programming languages affect the way people think about programming\", but rather \"how do natural languages affect the way people think about programming\". To get it out of the way, one language that clearly has a pragmatic advantage is English.  I think the advantage has little to do with programming languages choosing English keywords like if, for, while, and do, just as musicians who don't speak Italian aren't tripped up by words like forte.  It has more to do with communication of ideas with other programmers, as English is the lingua franca these days, at least in the programming world.  For instance, to ask a question in StackOverflow, you really need to know English and know it pretty well if you want good answers.  Although this sounds like an imperialist attitude, it really is true in practice. That aside, how do the intrinsic properties of languages affect how programmers who speak them think about data structures, algorithms, etc.?  Are any languages particularly concise when it comes to talking about logic and programming, allowing native speakers of those languages to think faster? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It is possible that different natural languages may influence the way programmers think about programming to some extent. For example, languages that have a more structured or logical syntax may make it easier for speakers to understand and write code in a similar fashion. On the other hand, languages that have more ambiguity or nuances in their grammar may require programmers to think in a more flexible or creative manner.  In terms of specific examples, it is possible that certain languages may have words or concepts that make it easier to convey programming ideas succinctly. For instance, a language that has specific words for concepts like recursion, iteration, or object-oriented programming may make it easier for programmers to communicate and think about these concepts.  However, it is important to note that overall, the differences in how natural languages influence programming thinking may be minimal compared to the impact of the actual programming languages being used. Ultimately, the logic and structure of the programming language itself will have a much larger impact on how programmers approach problem-solving and coding, regardless of the natural language they speak.  In conclusion, while there may be some minor differences in how natural languages influence programming thinking, the impact is likely to be relatively small compared to other factors such as the programming language being used. It is more important for programmers to focus on mastering the logic and syntax of the programming languages they work with, rather than worrying about how their native language may be influencing their programming mindset.",

Dijkstra said in one of his last interviews (as reprinted in CACM Vol. 53 No. 8, p. 44):  There is an enormous difference   between one who is monolingual and   someone who at least knows a second   language well, because it makes you   much more conscious about language   structure in general. You will   discover that certain constructions in   one language you just can't translate.  ",

        "Question": "Why are there so many programming languages? And what prompts someone to create a programming languages in spite of the fact that other languages already exist? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are many reasons why there are so many programming languages. One reason is that different programming languages are designed to solve different types of problems, and each language has its own strengths and weaknesses. Some languages are better suited for specific types of tasks, such as web development, artificial intelligence, or data analysis.   Additionally, technological advances and changes in the industry lead to the development of new programming languages. As computing power increases, new languages are created to take advantage of these capabilities and to address emerging challenges.   Another factor that prompts someone to create a new programming language is the desire to improve upon existing languages or to introduce new features and concepts. Different languages have different syntax, semantics, and programming paradigms, and some developers may feel that there is a need for a new language that offers a different approach or set of tools.  Overall, the diverse needs of developers and the evolving nature of technology drive the continued development of new programming languages.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Programming languages evolve New programming languages often learn from existing languages and add, remove and combine features in a new way. There is a few different paradigms like object oriented and functional and many modern languages try to mix features from them both. There is also new problems that needs to be solved, e.g. the increase of multi-core CPUs. The most common solution to that have been threads, but some programming languages try to solve the concurrency problem in a different way e.g. the Actor Model.

        "Question": "I have been offered an interesting job, but there's a big caveat for me: they use pair programming. I hate the idea of pair programming, and I'm probably not suited for it: I like to do frequent pauses, I hate to see someone programming (I would constantly poke the pair away to code myself), I have to be in full control of the machine I'm working on, I like to work listening music, and basically I don't like to being tied to someone else. I'm not even a social person. I have however never actually worked with true pair programming (besides few times for a short time to help someone else or to solve a complex task together)... so it is pair programming really that bad? And given my attitude, should I refuse the job or should I leave my current one and give a try?  For people that asked about it: I'm looking for a job where formal design and development are used, as I hate my current job where we are \"coding in the wild\". The company is very interested in my technical profile so they insisted even when I specified I never worked with pair programming and that I probably wouldn't like it (besides being an unsociable loner programmer, I don't like and believe the very concept of pair programming). ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Pair programming can be a very polarizing practice in the software development world. Some people swear by it and believe it leads to better code and more productivity, while others, like yourself, have strong aversions to it.   Given your personal preferences and work style, it seems like pair programming may not be the best fit for you. It's important to consider whether you would be happy and comfortable in a work environment that heavily relies on pair programming.   If the idea of pair programming is a deal-breaker for you and you strongly believe that you would not thrive in that environment, it may be best to decline the job offer. It's important to prioritize your own happiness and comfort in your work environment.  However, if you're open to trying out pair programming and are willing to give it a chance, it could be a valuable learning experience for you. You may find that your preconceived notions about pair programming are incorrect and that you actually enjoy it.   Ultimately, the decision is yours to make. Consider your own preferences, work style, and priorities before making a final decision. Good luck with whatever choice you make!",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Guess what - nobody likes pair programming at first. When I first tried pair programming I was against the idea and I had tons of objections similar to yours.  I don't like to watch someone else coding, I like to listen to music, I feel I'll be quicker working on my own, I don't want to stop and explain myself constantly, etc etc etc. Then I tried it.  And guess what?  It still sucked.  We were having all kinds of problems - I wanted to work different hours to the other guy, we had different keyboard settings and shortcuts, our desks didn't work very well for pair programming etc etc. This went on for about a week.  During that week we were rewriting the entire legacy login system for a distributed application.  We had to learn how some seriously difficult threading issues work, figure out how remoting sinks worked, change tons and tons of legacy code to work with our new login module and pretty much do some of the most hectic coding I've had to do in my career.  After a week of this we deployed it.. and everything just worked.  Not a single bug.  Not one. That's when I figured there might be something to this pair programming nonsense.  We started to do more pair programming.  We even started to force everyone to work in pairs.  It rocked.  I probably learnt more in a month of doing that than I did in the previous 2 years.  The other issues didn't go away.  Sometimes you'll be stuck with a pair that you dislike.  It's gonna happen.  Sometimes you'll struggle to find overlapping working hours.  Sometimes you'll want to just work on your own.  But the advantages of pair programming are just incredible. Since then I've always tried to do as much pair programming as possible.  It's simply the best way of learning.  This company forces everyone to do pair programming? Where do I sign up?  It seems to me they are really enlightened and you will be in a really intense working environment.  Awesome. Having said that, make sure that the pairs are rotated often.  You don't want to be stuck developing with one other developer for months on end - you'll go out of your mind.  We're all human, after all.  Also, check that this has been an ongoing practice for a while.  If it's not, it's not the end of the world, but if it's an accepted practice it's a massive green light. Trust me, you want to work for a company like that. ",

        "Question": "Quote from Wikipedia of the article \"High-level programming language\":  A high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. In comparison to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or be more portable across platforms. Such languages hide the details of CPU operations such as memory access models and management of scope.  I.e., as the level of programming language increases, the further away the programmer goes from the hardware on which the program runs. Now I do not know the statistics of language usages across levels, but I would suspect that the higher level languages more and more are replacing the lower level languages. If so, can this lead to a deficit of programmers with computer architecture knowledge? Would this be a problem for the industry? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It is possible that the increasing use of high-level programming languages could lead to a deficit of programmers with in-depth knowledge of computer architecture. This could potentially be a problem for the industry, as it may become more difficult to optimize code for performance and efficiency without a strong understanding of how the underlying hardware functions. It is important for programmers to have a solid understanding of computer architecture in order to write code that is both functional and efficient.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "It can, but likely won't lead to a problem. It's just economics.  If the vast majority of people lose the ability to understand the underlying architecture, and there is still a huge NEED to understand the underlying architecture, then the ones who do will have jobs and get paid more, while those who don't will only have jobs where that is not needed (and may still get paid more...who knows?). Is it helpful to know? Absolutely. You'll likely be better.  Is it necessary in most cases?  No.  That's why abstraction is so great, we stand on the shoulders of giants without having to be giants ourselves (but there will always be giants around). ",
