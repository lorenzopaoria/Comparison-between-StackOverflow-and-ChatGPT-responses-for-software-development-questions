        "Question": "Will Java have the same importance it had in the past, or it will be less relevant than nowadays? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It is difficult to predict the exact future importance of Java, as it depends on various factors such as advancements in technology, changes in programming languages and frameworks, and the evolving needs of the software development industry. However, Java has been a prominent programming language for many years and is widely used in various industries, so it is likely to remain relevant for the foreseeable future. As new technologies and languages emerge, Java may face competition, but it is still considered a stable and reliable language for building many types of applications. Overall, Java is likely to continue to be important in the programming world, although its dominance may decrease slightly over time.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Java is relevant and will continue to be relevant for many years in the Enterprise computing world.   Whether it continues to be relevant in other areas depends a lot on what Oracle does.  If they inject some life (and resources) into ME, desktop applications and other areas, and if they press on with the evolution of the Java language, then Java will do well.   But if Oracle cuts back on R&D and/or tries to stomp other players in the Java space, there's a good chance that someone / some company will develop a better (and more open) Java-like language.  If Oracle win their lawsuit against Google, I predict that the next generation of the Android platform will have a new language, just like happened with C#.  If Google get the openness right ... then, the game is on! ",

        "Question": "For a long time in SO and in other places Java has the reputation of being slow. From jokes to many comments in questions and answers, people still believe Java is slow based solely on experience with it in the 90s. This is my issue: we have disproved (most) of the reasons that people believe Java is slow. Outside of small things, Java is pretty fast. So why is it that people still refuse to believe Java is fast now? Is it part of their mindset that anything thats not C/C++ is slow? Is it because people don't check over time? Is it because people are just biased? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There could be multiple reasons why some people still believe Java is slow, even though it has greatly improved in terms of performance over the years.   One reason could be the long-standing reputation that Java had as being slow in the past. People may still hold onto this belief based on their past experiences with the language, even if the current version of Java is much faster.  Another reason could be perception bias. People may have a mindset that languages like C/C++ are inherently faster than languages like Java, and therefore are more inclined to believe that Java is slow without actually looking into the current performance benchmarks.  Another potential reason could be lack of updated information. If someone hasn't worked with Java in a long time, they may still believe it to be slow based on outdated information and not realizing the advancements that have been made in the language.  Ultimately, it could just be a matter of personal bias and preference. Some people may just prefer certain languages over others and are not willing to acknowledge the improvements made in languages like Java.   Overall, it's important to stay informed and keep up with the latest developments in programming languages to ensure that our perceptions are based on accurate and current information.",

        "Question": "Has anybody's organization started the migration from Java to Scala? If yes, how do you do that? What can I do to encourage my colleagues to do the same? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Migrating from Java to Scala can be a challenging process, but it can also bring many benefits in terms of productivity and maintainability. Here are some steps you can take to encourage your colleagues to make the switch:  1. Highlight the benefits of Scala: Make sure your colleagues are aware of the advantages of Scala over Java, such as its concise syntax, functional programming capabilities, and powerful type system. Show them how Scala can improve their productivity and make their code more robust and maintainable.  2. Offer training and resources: Organize workshops, training sessions, or coding sessions to help your colleagues get started with Scala. Provide them with resources such as books, online tutorials, and documentation to support their learning process.  3. Start small: Instead of trying to migrate the entire codebase at once, start by integrating Scala components into your existing Java code. This way, your colleagues can gradually familiarize themselves with Scala and see its benefits in practice.  4. Share success stories: If there are other teams or organizations that have successfully migrated from Java to Scala, share their experiences and success stories with your colleagues. This can serve as inspiration and motivation for them to take the leap.  5. Lead by example: Show your colleagues the code you have written in Scala and demonstrate how it simplifies complex tasks or improves the overall quality of the code. Lead by example and be a champion for Scala within your organization.  6. Address concerns and provide support: Some of your colleagues may have concerns about the migration process or lack confidence in their ability to learn a new language. Address their concerns, provide them with the support they need, and be patient as they transition to Scala.  Overall, the key to encouraging your colleagues to migrate from Java to Scala is to communicate the benefits, provide support and resources, and lead by example. By taking these steps, you can help to create a culture of learning and encourage your organization to embrace Scala as a modern and powerful programming language.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Probably the easiest way is to first use Scala only for testing. In this case, you might even not have to tell your boss :-) If he asks, tell him \"that's just my private test case, it's so much easier and faster to use Scala for it\".

        "Question": "It seems to me that rapid-development web platforms are going to radically change the world of web applications. It has been five years since Rails 1.0 was released for Ruby, and since that time we have seen Grails for Groovy, Django for Python, and Roo for Java. But to my knowledge (which is probably limited, being a Java/Groovy progammer) there is no similar framework for C#. Does such a thing exist?  If not, why not? Edit:  It's quite possible I'm not using the right words when I say \"rapid-development,\" but I'm talking about frameworks that can conceivably allow you to build a working blog engine in 30 minutes.  You couldn't reasonably do this with, say, Java, Spring, and Hibernate, given the various configuration needed to allow your controllers to be found, and both configuration and code necessary for your entities to persist and be retrieved.   So I'm talking about frameworks that handle all of the CRUD with a convention-over-configuration mentality.  If someone has the right words for what I'm talking about, let me know. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It sounds like you are referring to rapid application development (RAD) frameworks, which are designed to streamline the development process by providing pre-built components and automating common tasks like CRUD operations.   In the C# world, ASP.NET MVC is a popular framework that follows the convention-over-configuration approach and allows for rapid development of web applications. While it may require more configuration compared to some of the frameworks you mentioned, it still provides a lot of the functionality you are looking for.  Additionally, there are other RAD frameworks for C# such as NancyFx and ServiceStack that aim to simplify development and allow for quick prototyping of web applications.   In short, while C# may not have as many options as some other languages, there are still RAD frameworks available that can help speed up the development process and allow for quick creation of web applications.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "It seems to me that there is no name yet for this kind of framework you are all talking about in this thread. I call them for the moment just RAILS-like Frameworks: Frameworks that increment productivity by orchestrating other existing frameworks with the purpose of solving the basic needs of most web applications, but at the same time hiding all the complexities from the developer. By basic needs I mean the implementation of a Persistence Provider, a Dependency Inyection Container, a Logging tool, an MVC platform, an HTML Template Engine, a Web Site Template Starter Kit with CSS presets, a Security Framework and some Javascript Library for AJAX features and other cool stuff. The RAILS-like Frameworks orchestrate all these frameworks and tools on the basis of the Domain model (the entities of your system with its attributes). Thanks to the Convention-over-Configuration principle, these frameworks avoid the need of defining lots of configuration files usually required by the frameworks they orchestrate (like Spring, Spring MVC, Hibernate, Log4J, etc.), assuming configurations by default based on naming, structure and metadata included in the same classes definitions. Thanks to the dynamic languages that these frameworks make use (like Ruby, Groovy, Python, Clojure, etc.), with the exception of SpringRoo that implements dynamic behaviour in Java by using AspectJ, the functionality that belongs to the frameworks underneath are extended and are made available to the developer in such a uniform and elegant manner that he/she is just aware of the underlying technologies. Finally thanks to the Scaffold technique, unit tests, integration tests, controllers and views are automatically generated for the main functions (CRUD) over each one of the domain objects defined by the developer. In the .NET world nothing has been developed yet, following all the previous definitions. But nothing prevents that from occurring soon. There are great frameworks, tools and libraries already available in the .NET world that can be orchestrated by a new RAILS-like framework made for the CLR. There are Unity, Spring.NET and Castle Windsor among others for the Dependency Inyection needs. Entity Framework 4, NHibernate and iBatis.NET are pretty good .NET Persistence Providers. ASP.NET MVC have strongly arrived with support for various Template Engines besides the traditional ASP.NET. Even if nobody achieves to use a DLR language to build this kind of framework, anyone with enough will can follow the SpringSource path and implement a RAILS-like framework with some static language like F#, C# or VB.NET, making use of an Aspect-Oriented Container (like AspectSharp or Gripper-LOOM.NET) to obtain dynamic behaviour. I would love to know about any group of people trying to develop such framework in .NET. ",

        "Question": "I'm writing a small database-centric application in Java Swing that will be used internally in a small company. I haven't much experience with developing production-level applications. I don't use an ORM, just a few simple methods that run SQL queries with Java JDBC. On every method that access the database I use a try-catch statement for SQLException and IOException. Should I do any logging here? In case I should, how much should I log? Please give me examples of good practice in this case. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Logging is a crucial aspect of any application, especially for tracking errors and debugging issues in production. In your case, since you are already using try-catch statements to handle exceptions, adding logging statements can provide valuable information about what went wrong when an error occurs.  Here are some suggestions for logging in your application:  1. Log Errors: Whenever an SQLException or IOException is caught, log the error message along with any relevant information that might help in diagnosing the issue. You can use a logging framework like Log4j or java.util.logging for this purpose.  Example: ```java try {     // Database query code } catch (SQLException e) {     LOGGER.error(\"Error executing SQL query: \" + e.getMessage(), e); } ```  2. Log Method Entry and Exit: You can also log when a method starts executing and when it finishes. This can help in understanding the flow of your application and identifying potential performance issues.  Example: ```java public void someMethod() {     LOGGER.info(\"Entering someMethod\");     // Method code     LOGGER.info(\"Exiting someMethod\"); } ```  3. Log SQL Queries: If your application is running complex SQL queries, logging the actual queries can be helpful for troubleshooting performance or data-related issues.  Example: ```java String sqlQuery = \"SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = ?\"; LOGGER.debug(\"Executing SQL query: \" + sqlQuery); ```  4. Use Different Log Levels: Use log levels like INFO, DEBUG, WARN, and ERROR based on the severity of the message. This will help in filtering out irrelevant log messages during debugging.  Example: ```java LOGGER.info(\"Application startup completed successfully\"); LOGGER.debug(\"Debugging information\"); LOGGER.warn(\"Potential issue detected\"); LOGGER.error(\"Error occurred: \" + e.getMessage(), e); ```  Overall, logging is an essential part of application development, and adding appropriate logging statements to your database-centric application can save you a lot of time and effort in troubleshooting issues. Remember to strike a balance between logging enough information for debugging and not cluttering your logs with unnecessary details.",

Use some kind of a logging infrastructure. If the exception can occur during the normal operation, report it in debug level. If it is a real problem, report it in error level. Either way you will have a way to troubleshoot the system by raising the log level. Also - when you report an exception always make sure the the entire stack trace + inner exceptions are printed. ",

Java has been a popular choice for Linux application development due to its platform independence, strong community support, and widespread adoption in the industry. However, it is not necessarily the de facto standard for all Linux application development, as there are other programming languages and frameworks that are also widely used in the Linux ecosystem, such as Python, C/C++, and Go.  On the other hand, .NET has traditionally been the standard for Windows application development, as it is developed by Microsoft and integrates well with their operating system. However, with the introduction of .NET Core, which is cross-platform and open source, it has also gained popularity for Linux application development.

What are the limits to the Java-Jython and Java-JRuby integration right now? What about Groovy: are there any things that a Java class can do that a Groovy class cannot? And what about IDE integration (mostly Eclipse, but IntelliJ and Netbeans are also interesting)? I'm not interested in whether Python, Ruby or Groovy is better/more-concise/whatever. I'm just interested in how well they are working in the JVM and tools (especially IDEs) right now. My main interest is not inside a web server, if that matters. Simple examples of getting a HelloWorld which extends a custom Java class and implements a custom Java interface would be very useful to me.  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Currently, the integration of Python (Jython) and Ruby (JRuby) with Java is quite solid. Both Jython and JRuby provide seamless interoperability with Java code, allowing you to access Java classes, extend Java classes, implement Java interfaces, and utilize Java libraries within your Python or Ruby code.  Some key limitations to be aware of include potential performance differences compared to native Java code, as well as certain advanced Java features that may not be fully supported in the Python or Ruby runtime environments. For example, Java reflection and dynamic class loading may not work as expected in Jython or JRuby.  In terms of Groovy, it is designed to be fully interoperable with Java and therefore does not have any inherent limitations compared to Java classes. Groovy classes can easily extend Java classes, implement Java interfaces, and work with Java libraries without any significant restrictions.  Regarding IDE integration, both Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA provide excellent support for Jython, JRuby, and Groovy development. These IDEs offer syntax highlighting, code completion, refactoring tools, debugging support, and integration with build and deployment tools for all three languages. NetBeans also has decent support for these languages, but may not be as feature-rich compared to Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA.  To create a simple HelloWorld example that extends a custom Java class and implements a custom Java interface in Jython, you can use the following code snippet:  ```python from com.example import CustomJavaClass, CustomJavaInterface  class HelloWorld(CustomJavaClass, CustomJavaInterface):     def __init__(self):         super().__init__()      def sayHello(self):         print(\"Hello, World!\")  hello = HelloWorld() hello.sayHello() ```  In JRuby, a similar example can be created as follows:  ```ruby require 'java' java_import 'com.example.CustomJavaClass' java_import 'com.example.CustomJavaInterface'  class HelloWorld < CustomJavaClass   include CustomJavaInterface    def say_hello     puts \"Hello, World!\"   end end  hello = HelloWorld.new hello.say_hello ```  In Groovy, the code would look like this:  ```groovy package com.example  class HelloWorld extends CustomJavaClass implements CustomJavaInterface {     void sayHello() {         println \"Hello, World!\"     } }  def hello = new HelloWorld() hello.sayHello() ```  Overall, Python (Jython), Ruby (JRuby), and Groovy offer robust integration with Java on the JVM, with solid IDE support for development tasks. With the examples provided above, you should be able to get started on leveraging Java classes and interfaces within your Python, Ruby, or Groovy applications.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I have no experience of JRuby nor Groovy. But Jython:  Excellent integration with NetBeans. NetBeans can run Python programs with Jython almost straight out of the box, just install the \"Jython Distribution\" plugin and you're done. Apparently Eclipse works as well. See chapter Using Jython in an IDE in the Jython Book. Java-Jython integration is excellent. Calling Java from Jython is super easy. Calling Jython from Java is not quite as straightforward (Java was not designed with Jython in mind), but still fairly easy. I've mostly had luck with creating a class in Jython (extending a Java class/interface), and then creating instances of that class in Java using an object factory. See Jython and Java Integration for how-to.  Extending a Java class in Jython works like this: from javax.swing import JFrame, JButton  class MyFrame(JFrame):      def __init__(self):         self.defaultCloseOperation = JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE         self.size = (300, 300)         self.add(JButton('Click Me!', actionPerformed=self.print_something))         self.visible = True      def print_something(self, event):         print 'Clicked!'  Implementing interfaces works similarly, just import the interface, \"extend\" it using a class definition such as class MyClass(MyInterface) and implement what's needed.  My only criticism against Jython is that its raw performance is not very good (and that's mostly because it uses massive reflection to interact with Java). But then, raw performance is usually pretty irrelevant for a scripting language. ",

Yet I've not been aware of any way that Python code that I've written would work differently on another machine.  (Though I haven't written that much Python.) So what am I missing?  How is the JVM different from a Python interpreter?  Is there a way that Python lacks Java's platform independence?  Or is this just a cultural difference? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "The concept of \"Write Once, Run Anywhere\" is often associated with Java due to its platform independence achieved through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). When you write Java code, it is compiled into bytecode that can run on any platform that has a JVM installed. This allows Java programs to be portable and run on different operating systems without needing to be recompiled.  Python, on the other hand, is an interpreted language, which means that Python code is executed directly by the Python interpreter. While Python code is generally platform-independent in the sense that it can run on different operating systems without modification, it is not compiled into a platform-neutral bytecode like Java. This means that Python code may require the Python interpreter to be installed on the target machine in order to run.  In terms of platform independence, both Java and Python can be considered as fairly portable and can run on different platforms without major modifications. However, Java's JVM provides a more standardized and consistent approach to achieving platform independence, whereas Python relies on the availability of the Python interpreter on the target platform.  In conclusion, while Python lacks the same level of platform independence provided by the JVM in Java, both languages are still capable of running on multiple platforms with relative ease.

This makes it easier to track down the history of the code without cluttering the source files with mod lines.  However, if you still find it useful to include this information in your Java code files, you can certainly do so. One option could be to add a comment at the top of each file with the modification information, similar to what you have seen in C code. Another option could be to use Java annotations to document changes made to specific methods or classes, although this may not provide as much visibility at a glance as mod lines.  Ultimately, the decision to include modification information in your Java code files will depend on your team's coding standards and preferences. It's important to strike a balance between providing useful information for future reference and keeping the code clean and concise.",

        "Question": "EDIT: This question at first seems to be bashing Java, and I guess at this point it is a bit. However, the bigger point I am trying to make is why any one single language is chosen as the one end all be all solution to all problems. Java happens to be the one that's used so that's the one I had to beat on here, but I'm not intentionality ripping Java a new one :) I don't like Java in most academic settings. I'm not saying the language itself is bad -- it has several extremely desirable aspects, most importantly the ability to run without recompilation on most any platform. Nothing wrong with using the language for Your Next App ^TM. (Not something I would personally do, but that's more because I have less experience with it, rather than it's design being poor) I think it is a waste that high level CS courses are taught using Java as a language. Too many of my co-students cannot program worth a damn, because they don't know how to work in a non-garbage-collected world. They don't fundamentally understand the machines they are programming for. When someone can work outside of a garbage collected world, they can work inside of one, but not vice versa. GC is a tool, not a crutch. But the way it is used to teach computer science students is a as a crutch. Computer science should not teach an entire suite of courses tailored to a single language. Students leave with the idea that all good design is idiomatic Java design, and that Object Oriented Design is the ONE TRUE WAY THAT IS THE ONLY WAY THINGS CAN BE DONE. Other languages, at least one of them not being a garbage collected language, should be used in teaching, in order to give the graduate a better understanding of the machines. It is an embarrassment that somebody with a PHD in CS from a respected institution cannot program their way out of a paper bag. What's worse, is that when I talk to those CS professors who actually do understand how things operate, they share feelings like this, that we're doing a disservice to our students by doing everything in Java. (Note that the above would be the same if I replaced it with any other language, generally using a single language is the problem, not Java itself) In total, I feel I can no longer respect any kind of degree at all -- when I can't see those around me able to program their way out of fizzbuzz problems. Why/how did it get to be this way? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It is important to note that the issue lies not with the Java language itself, but with the over-reliance on it in computer science education. By teaching students solely in Java, they are not being given a well-rounded understanding of programming and computer science principles. Students may become so ingrained in Java's specific syntax and design patterns that they are unable to adapt to other languages or understand fundamental concepts that transcend specific languages.  It is crucial for computer science programs to expose students to a variety of languages, including at least one non-garbage collected language, in order to cultivate a deeper understanding of programming and computational principles. By diversifying the programming languages used in education, students will be better equipped to adapt to different programming paradigms and technologies in the real world.  Relying solely on Java as the foundation for computer science education limits students' abilities to think critically and problem-solve in a variety of contexts. It is important for education institutions to evolve and adapt their curriculum to provide students with a well-rounded, comprehensive understanding of programming and computer science principles.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "This isn't a Java problem, it's a teaching problem. Not knowing how to program is not a languages fault, it's the students fault. Same goes for all your issues, GC, basic machine knowledge, how things work \"under the hood\" so to speak. Your major gripe about garbage collection throws me slightly. Unless you're doing C or C++ garbage collection is typically very good and not an issue. Would you rather they all learn assembly? Higher level languages that are strict are very useful for teaching. It gives you the flexibility of libraries, packages, and other niceties when you need it, without any of the confusing language \"sugar\" present in most other higher level languages (PHP, Ruby, Python, Perl).

        "Question": "I'm in the throes of getting myself enrolled in school to get a CS degree. The school I am looking at actually offers both Java- and C++-based for the introductory software development courses (object-oriented programming, design patterns, that sort of thing). It is student's choice which track to follow, but there is only time to follow one. Knowing what you know now, if you had the choice, would you lay down your CS curriculum foundation in Java or C++? My current debate currently looks like this: A good friend (who has a PhD in AI) is touting Java as the better choice regardless of what I do, if only to open up more job opportunities later, though he might be biased since all of his work has been in Java (he loves it). I live in the Boston, MA, USA area and I see an equal amount of Java and C work.  On the flip side, although I haven't entirely yet settled on what I want to do with the degree when I'm done, my preference would be to develop for the Mac, which I am doing now albeit in a limited capacity. To that end, I'm getting some limited exposure to C++ already, but I've had none with Java, and looking at my projects at my day job I don't see a need to use it anytime soon, \"soon\" measured by at least two years. I probably should note that I'm an adult going back to school after 20 years (I currently have no degree of any kind) so I'm looking to maximize the opportunity and time spent as best I can. I'm kind of leaning towards C++ but I'm still ambivalent, and some outside, objective advice would help here. Or I could just be thinking too hard about it. UPDATE: It turns out the language selection wasn't so clear cut as I originally surmised. While a couple of core courses focused on Java, some of the other core courses work in primarily C and Java, but also a few others thrown in for good measure. In fact, my rest of my semester is going to be in Objective-C after spending time in Java and Javascript. Last semester was C, Javascript, and PHP, plus a few others thrown in as assignments required. Since things were pretty much split down the middle overall, and I am still getting answers to this, I am now trying to work my curriculum such that I meet all of the requirements for the degree but to absorb as many languages as I can reasonably handle. So far, my grades have not suffered trying to do this. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Given that you are in the Boston area and are interested in developing for Mac, it may be beneficial for you to focus on learning C++ as a foundation for your CS degree. C++ is often used in Mac development and having a strong understanding of it could be advantageous for your career goals. Additionally, since you are already getting some exposure to C++, it may be easier for you to continue building on that knowledge throughout your degree program.   That being said, Java is a widely-used language in the industry and can also open up a lot of job opportunities for you. It may be worth considering taking some courses in Java as well to broaden your skill set. Since you have the opportunity to learn multiple languages in your degree program, you can take advantage of that and try to gain proficiency in both C++ and Java.   Overall, it's great that you are thinking about maximizing your time in school and trying to absorb as many languages as possible. Ultimately, the decision between Java and C++ may depend on your career goals and personal preferences. It's great that you are already thinking about this and considering all options before making a decision. Good luck with your studies!",

        "Question": "The specific example I have in mind involves the currently-alpha game Minecraft, but this is a general question that I think warrants some conversation. Minecraft is written in Java, and stack traces usually look like this (real example): java.lang.NullPointerException     at d.a(SourceFile:247)     at gi.b(SourceFile:92)     at bd.a(SourceFile:33)     at bn.a(SourceFile:69)     at bn.e(SourceFile:115)     at bn.d(SourceFile:103)     at net.minecraft.client.Minecraft.i(SourceFile:1007)     at net.minecraft.client.Minecraft.run(SourceFile:596)     at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)  Obviously these are not the real package and method names that the developer uses when he writes.  Since he is in an alpha stage, it seems that the developer should like to be able to make sense of his stack traces, especially if someone is able to provide one for a bug report.  As this stands, it's mostly meaningless. What advantage could one possibly hope to gain by obfuscating his code like this that overcomes the drawbacks of more difficult bug identification? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One possible advantage of obfuscating code is that it can help protect intellectual property by making it more difficult for others to reverse engineer or steal the code. This can be important for developers who want to prevent unauthorized use or distribution of their software.  However, in the case of a game like Minecraft, where the code is already widely accessible and modifiable due to its open-source nature, the benefits of obfuscation may be limited. In such cases, the drawbacks of making it difficult to troubleshoot and identify bugs in the code may outweigh the potential benefits of obfuscation.  It's possible that the developer of Minecraft is using obfuscation as a security measure or as a way to optimize the performance of the game. However, it's also important for developers to consider the impact of obfuscation on the ability to debug and troubleshoot issues, especially in a game that is still in alpha development and may have many bugs that need to be addressed. Ultimately, it's a balance that each developer will need to consider based on their specific circumstances and priorities.",

The advantage is that it makes it harder to reverse-engineer (if you are worried about someone stealing your code base and using it as a base to create a similar competing product, for example, etc). You can get the original stack trace back: there are obfuscation tools out there which create special reference files which you can use to run the obfuscated stack traces through, and it comes out with the original source stack trace. These are generated by the obfuscation process itself, so you can't get the original stack trace back unless you have your hands on the reference file that you used to obfuscate the code in the first place.

I'm thinking however, since GWT deploys Java applications in JavaScript why should I learn GWT when I could learn the actual thing instead (this being JavaScript).  My question: is it worth it?

However, if your main goal is to build JavaScript applications, learning JavaScript directly would be beneficial as well. JavaScript is a widely used language for web development and is essential for front-end development. It is always a good idea to have a strong understanding of JavaScript, even if you choose to use GWT for your projects.

        "Question": "Java's checked exceptions have gotten some bad press over the years. A telling sign is that it's literally the only language in the world that has them (not even other JVM languages like Groovy and Scala). Prominent Java libraries like Spring and Hibernate also don't use them.  I personally have found one use for them (in business logic between layers), but otherwise I'm pretty anti-checked exceptions. Are there any other uses that I don't realize? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Checked exceptions in Java were originally introduced as a way to force developers to handle potential errors or exceptions that could occur during runtime. However, they have been criticized for being too restrictive and often leading to verbose and cluttered code.  One potential use for checked exceptions is in scenarios where the caller of a method needs to be aware of and handle the exception. This can be particularly useful in cases where the exception is recoverable and the caller needs to take specific actions to address it.  Another potential use for checked exceptions is in APIs where developers need to be explicitly aware of potential errors that may be thrown. By forcing developers to explicitly handle these exceptions, it can help improve the overall reliability and robustness of the code.  Overall, while checked exceptions can be useful in certain scenarios, they are generally considered to be more of a burden than a benefit by many developers. As a result, many modern Java libraries and frameworks tend to avoid them in favor of other error handling mechanisms such as runtime exceptions or custom error handling strategies.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "First of all, like any other programming paradigm you need to do it right for it to work well.   For me the advantage of checked exceptions is that the authors of the Java runtime library ALREADY have decided for me what common problems I might reasonably be expected to be able to handle at the calling point (as opposed to a top-level catch-print-die block) and consider as early as possible how to handle these problems. I like checked exceptions because they make my code more robust by forcing me to think about error recovery as early as possible. To be more precise, to me this makes my code more robust as it forces me to consider strange corner cases very early in the process as opposed to saying \"Oops, my code does not handle if the file doesn't exist yet\" based on an error in production, which you then have to rework your code to handle.  Adding error handling to existing code can be a non-trivial task - and hence expensive - when reaching maintenance as opposed to just doing it right from the start. It might be that the missing file is a fatal thing and should cause the program to crash in flames, but then you make that decision with } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {   throw new RuntimeException(\"Important file not present\", e); }  This also shows a very important side effect.  If you wrap an exception, you can add an explanation which goes in the stack-trace!  This is so extremely powerful because you can add information about e.g. the name of the file that was missing, or the parameters passed to this method or other diagnostic information, and that information is present right in the stack trace which frequently is the single thing you get when a program has crashed. People may say \"we can just run this in the debugger to reproduce\", but I have found that very frequently production errors cannot be reproduced later, and we cannot run debuggers in production except for very nasty cases where essentially your job is at stake. The more information in your stack trace, the better.  Checked exceptions help me get that information in there, and early.  EDIT:  This goes for library designers as well.  One library I use on a daily basis contains many, many checked exceptions which could have been designed much better making it less tedious to use. ",

Is Java still the language of choice for multi platform development?  Please be specific with focus on cross platform aspects. I am not asking for general language feature comparisons.

        "ChatGpt answer": "It really depends on the specific needs and requirements of the project.

However, other languages such as Python, JavaScript (used in web development), and PHP also have strong cross-platform capabilities. Python, for example, is known for its ease of use and readability, making it a popular choice for cross-platform scripting and automation tasks. JavaScript, on the other hand, is widely used for web development and has cross-platform capabilities through web browsers.

One of the main advantages of Java over .NET is its cross-platform compatibility. Java programs can run on any platform that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, which includes Windows, Linux, and MacOS. This would make it easier for you to port your project to different operating systems in the future.   In terms of libraries and tools, Java has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and tools available that can help you to speed up development and improve the performance of your project. Additionally, Java has a large and active community that is constantly developing new libraries and tools to help Java developers.  Another factor to consider is the cost. While Oracle has been trying to monetize Java, there are open-source alternatives such as OpenJDK that are free to use. On the other hand, .NET is a Microsoft technology, so you may need to pay for licenses to use certain features or tools.  In terms of development process, Java is known for being easy to learn and use, which can help to speed up development. Additionally, Java has a strong emphasis on performance, which can be important for certain projects.

        "Stack Overflow best answer": "The single most important (edit: technical) decision is:  Will you at this point in time commit 100% to use Windows as your future deployment platform?   If no, then you should go with Java.  The conclusion from Mono is frequently used to say \"Yes, .NET is cross-platform\". How valid is that claim? was that Mono is only an option IFF you develop against it!   You cannot expect .NET-applications to work out of the box.  @Basic said that this was more a comment than an answer.  To be precise I consider it a question to go on top of the list, because this is perhaps the most important technical decision you need to do when dealing with .NET.  As Basic says he will test against Mono, then that is out of the way, and I would consider Java and .NET to be pretty equally well suited.  I have very little experience with .NET, but quite a bit in Java.   Performance - Java runs pretty well, but still has quite a bit of startup time.  This is because a JVM starts from scratch when being initialized, and the random access of the runtime library jar file is rather slow when needing to be read in from disk.  Recent Java 6's have a background process to try to keep the runtime library jar files in the disk cache so access is fast when needed. Tools available.  Plenty of tools exist, and there is a lot available as high quality Open Source.  IBM has some very advanced tooling available, but they also take quite a bit of money for them.  You may want to have a look at MyEclipse who make a living from putting together the best parts in the Java world and make them accessible for a low cost, to see what is available.  Netbeans has a very nice GUI editor.  JDeveloper has a nice Swing debugger.  The Sun 6 JDK has VisualVM which is a nice entry level profiler which can analyze already running programs (which is a killer feature). Cross platform compatibility.  Very good, tending to excellent.  The JVM is very, very reliable and predictable.  Issues only show when operating system differences seep in - like file separators, file name case sensitivity and menu behaviour.  Libraries.  There are many and many of them are freely available and usable, but primarily written in Java as it is rather difficult to pull in code written in non-JVM languages. Cost.  Java is basically freely available.  What Oracle is indicating is that the power tools - most likely coming from JRocket - will be at a cost.  Also note that exended support (\"Java for Business\") also comes for a price.   Non-x86 platforms are a dying breed, but IBM has plenty and IBM provides an excellent Java implementation for them.  This is priced as  being a part of the operating system - most likely for better adoption. Development process.   Much time with Java is spent researching and choosing the appropriate technology and learning it, but when that is done I think there are plenty of technologies which are quite fast to develop with.  The latest version of Java EE provides for writing very powerful web pages using Facelets which can be reloaded at least as fast as PHP pages.  I think that unless you are not skilled in neither Java or .NET, you will save time and money by choosing the technology you and your organization are the most familiar with. ",

        "Stack Overflow best answer": "A few Universities have somebody who's sufficiently well known that many (if not most) decisions revolve around that person's likes, dislikes, opinions, taste, etc. Just for example, Texas A&M has Bjarne Stroustrup on staff; it probably comes as little surprise to anybody that their curriculum tends to emphasize C++. Most universities are a bit different though. First, decisions are often made much more for the benefit of the faculty than the students. The single biggest criterion in many cases is \"which language requires the least effort on our part?\" Most of them are also careful in their laziness -- they want not only the language with the fewest advanced concepts to learn, but also one that is (for example) the slowest to innovate, update, or embrace anything new. Second, most decisions are made by committee. This means the final decision is rarely (if ever) what anybody actually wanted -- it's just what the fewest members of the committee (especially those with the most influence) found particularly objectionable. It's like picking a flavor of ice cream. One really likes strawberry, but another is allergic to strawberries. Another really loves chocolate, but somebody else can't stand it.  Yet another thinks rum raisin is great, but the other two worry that mentioning \"rum\" would be interpreted as encouraging alcohol abuse -- so they end up with vanilla, even though it's not what anybody really wanted. Finally, even though it usually runs directly contrary to most of what the previous two criteria would produce in isolation, they generally need (or at least want) to be seen as responsive to the needs of industry. Java is the intersection of these three:  Every concept it embodies was well known by 1980. There's not much to know beyond the very most basic notion of what OOP is. It's the tasteless, odorless, non-toxic, biodegradable, politically correct choice. Nearly the only other language in history to have existed as long and (probably) innovated less is SQL. Even though they're hardly what you'd call fast-moving targets, COBOL and Fortran have still both innovated more than Java. It is widely used. When you get down to it, profs and PHBs have similar criteria.  Note that I'm not really saying (for example) that there's nothing more to know about Java than the most basic notion of what OOP is -- only that that's all that's needed to do what passes for an acceptable job of teaching it.

A more complete demonstration if how it may be used may be represented in the following graph:  Additional examples of Java standard library APIs that require certain sequences are java.io.PrintStream (very similar to the one above) and java.util.Iterator (which requires a next() call between every two remove() calls, thus enforcing a certain sequence).

In order to play audio or video using the MediaPlayer, you need to initialize the MediaPlayer object, set the data source using the setDataSource() method, prepare the MediaPlayer using the prepare() method, start the playback using the start() method, and release the resources using the release() method when done.  These are just a few examples of public APIs that require specific sequences of actions for correct usage. There are many more out there, and I'm sure other developers will have encountered additional examples in their own work.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "From the Spring framework The Lifecycle interface forces the following action sequence: start (isRunning)* stop  which is used in just about all the principal components that make up the framework. Fortunately, this lifecycle is managed by the container. From the Hibernate framework The Lifecycle interface supports the following action sequence: (onDelete, onSave, onUpdate)* onLoad  From the Servlet API My all-time favourite - the lifecycle of a servlet: init service destroy  with service delegating to the doGet, doPost operations etc.  ",

        "Question": "I started learning Java a couple of months ago. I also wanted to become more exposed to linux so I installed ubuntu and started working with Java since then. In the meanwhile however I became more interested in C# and in learning the Windows platform. At this point I'm asking myself if I should stop learning Java and move to the .NET world. I don't hate or dislike Java by the way, I am just more curious about windows/.NET at this point in time.  My question is, should I remain with Java or go with C#/.NET? What is your advice?   ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Ultimately, the decision on whether to stick with Java or switch to C#/.NET depends on your long-term goals and interests. If you are more curious about the Windows platform and have a particular interest in learning C#/.NET, it may be beneficial for you to switch and explore that path.   However, it's also worth considering the skills and experience you have already gained with Java. Java is a widely-used programming language with a large community and many potential job opportunities. If you are comfortable with Java and enjoy working with it, there may still be value in continuing to build your expertise in that area.  It's important to remember that learning multiple languages and technologies can be beneficial in the long run, as it can make you a more well-rounded and versatile developer. If you have the time and interest, you could consider continuing with Java while also exploring C#/.NET on the side.  Ultimately, the decision is up to you and what you feel will best help you achieve your goals and interests in the field of programming.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "If it will help your decision, Java is a relatively stable language; it's speed of evolution is much slower than that of C#.  Consequently, C# is getting all of the cool new features more rapidly than Java.  Whether this is a good thing or not depends on your own point of view. ",

        "Question": "Not talking about the recent Java/Oracle debacle here, but something I've been wondering recently. When I first started programming, Java was the big thing client-side, however these days you hardly ever see a Java applet whereas Flash and Javascript are ubiquitous. Where did Java go wrong? Did Sun decide to concentrate on the server-side and let client-side stagnate? How did Flash become dominant over Java? Flashy (no pun intended) graphics? Marketing? Never having been a Java developer, I've not followed this closely so I'm interested to hear your thoughts. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are several reasons why Java lost its popularity as a client-side technology and Flash became dominant.  1. Performance: Java applets were known to be slow and resource-intensive compared to Flash, which had better performance and smoother animations.  2. Browser support: Java applets required a browser plugin to run, whereas Flash became embedded in most browsers, making it more convenient for users.  3. Development tools: Flash had a more user-friendly development environment, making it easier for developers to create interactive and visually appealing content.  4. Mobile support: Flash had better support for mobile devices, which were becoming increasingly popular at the time.  5. Marketing: Adobe, the creator of Flash, did a better job at marketing their product and creating partnerships with other companies.  Overall, it was a combination of factors that led to Java losing its dominance in the client-side space. However, Java continued to be popular on the server-side, where its robustness and security features have made it a preferred choice for many developers.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": " Firewalls would sometimes block java applets, so developers couldn't be sure if they were going to work or not. They required a browser plug-in, which led many developers to favour javascript over java applets, so that they didn't require the user to download and install a plug-in.  The Macromedia Flash plug-in had a simpler, more seamless, and less noisy means for downloading, installing and updating. The API wasn't so standardized then, so applets could fail to work if the user didn't have the right version of java installed. They had a slow loading time and used too much memory.  They would often crash the browser. Java applets died before Swing came out, so GUIs were difficult and ugly. IE wasn't so good at supporting applets fully, so compatibility was difficult to sort out. Flash and javascript are much easier to use for non-programmers.  ",

        "Question": "I have seen several times on this site posts that decry Java's implementation of generics. Now, I can honestly say that I have not had any issues with using them. However, I have not attempted to make a generic class myself. So, what are your issues with Java's generic support? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are a few common issues that some developers have with Java's implementation of generics:  1. Type erasure: One major limitation of Java's generics is that type information is erased at runtime. This can lead to situations where you lose type safety, as the compiler cannot enforce type constraints at runtime. This can potentially lead to ClassCastException at runtime if the wrong type is used.  2. Inability to use primitive types: Java's generics do not support primitive types like int, char, or double. Instead, you have to use their respective wrapper classes (e.g. Integer, Character, Double), which can lead to performance overhead and increased memory usage.  3. Cumbersome syntax: Some developers find the syntax for defining generic classes and methods in Java to be verbose and cumbersome. The use of angle brackets and type parameters can make code harder to read and understand, especially for beginners.  4. Limited support for variance: Java only supports covariance and contravariance for arrays, making it harder to express certain relationships between types. This can lead to situations where you have to resort to casting or using wildcard types to achieve the desired behavior.  Overall, while Java's generics provide some level of type safety and code reuse, they have certain limitations that can make them less flexible and intuitive compared to other languages' implementations of generics.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Java's generic implementation uses type erasure. This means that your strongly typed generic collections are actually of type Object at runtime. This has some performance considerations as it means primitive types must be boxed when added to a generic collection. Of course the benefits of compile time type correctness outweigh the general silliness of type erasure and obsessive focus on backwards compatibility. ",

        "Question": "I'm an experienced Java developer who is just starting up a project for an NGO. I will be working on the project for at least 6 months, following which the NGO will have to pay or find a volunteer to maintain the project. Seeing as they already have people working on their website in PHP, I figured PHP was the obvious choice to make sure the skills are still available (it is webby) - eliminated Java because Java devs are typically expensive. Unfortunately I have next to zero experience with proper PHP development (just a few months spending a small percentage of my time on a Drupal project without any real coding). What are some things I can do to ensure that the code I leave behind is maintainable by a relatively low-skilled PHP developer (eg a teenager wanting to make some holiday cash)? Do I go with a CMS? Are Drupal developers cheap? Any other CMS / Framework I should look at?  Background: the project is a website that people will search for educational information, with some simple user-management to only allow some users to create content, restrictions to specific content-types etc.  The CMS vs write myself question is not the only thing I'm interested in hearing. I'm also interested in any tips about code style, anything you think my Java experience would push me towards that is going to make it difficult for the hypothetical volunteer etc. There's probably things about this scenario that I haven't thought through - so anything related to keeping maintenance costs low would be appreciated. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Given your background in Java development, there are several things you can do to ensure that the PHP code you leave behind is maintainable by a lower-skilled PHP developer.  1. Choose a well-documented and widely-used PHP framework: Opting for a popular PHP framework like Laravel or Symfony can make it easier for a less experienced developer to understand and work with the code. These frameworks have extensive documentation, active communities, and provide best practices for development.  2. Follow PHP coding standards: PHP has its own coding standards (PSR) that dictate how code should be written to ensure consistency and readability. Following these standards will make it easier for other developers to understand your code.  3. Use MVC architecture: Implementing a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture in your project will help separate the different components of your application, making it easier for others to work on and maintain.  4. Avoid complex design patterns: While design patterns can be powerful tools in Java development, they can be daunting for less experienced PHP developers. Keep your code simple and easy to understand.  5. Consider using a CMS: If the website's functionality is mainly content-based, using a CMS like WordPress or Drupal may be a cost-effective solution. These platforms are user-friendly and have a large community of developers who can help maintain the site.  6. Document your code: Provide clear documentation for your code, including comments and explanations of its functionality. This will make it easier for others to follow and make changes in the future.  7. Test your code thoroughly: Implement unit testing and integration testing to ensure that your code works as expected. This will help prevent bugs and make it easier for others to make changes without breaking anything.  8. Train the volunteers: Before handing over the project, provide training and support to the volunteers who will be maintaining the code. This will help them understand the project better and be more effective in their work.  By following these guidelines and being mindful of the skill level of potential future developers, you can make sure that the code you leave behind is maintainable and cost-effective for the NGO.",

I'm interested however in problems that Java can solve better than C#/.NET or C#/.NET can solve better than Java. Leaving aside the 'cost' factor, since that is somehow not an issue for big enterprise companies (the developers probably cost more than the licenses from Microsoft - it's just a thought) and even for small projects there are free/open-source tools for .NET so the cost can be zero for the .NET world as well. With Mono, you can port .NET to Linux and MacOS as well so the benefit that Java had(cross platform) isn't THE decision factor to use Java nowadays.. What real world problems can you think of where .NET would be a much better solution than Java, and vice-versa? I'm only interested in solutions to problems. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One advantage of .NET over Java is the seamless integration with Microsoft products and services. If an organization heavily relies on Microsoft technologies such as Azure, SharePoint, or Exchange, using .NET can provide a more cohesive and integrated development experience.  On the other hand, Java has a larger ecosystem and a more mature set of libraries and tools for certain domains such as big data processing (Hadoop, Spark), scientific computing (Apache Mahout), and enterprise integration (Apache Camel). If a project requires specific tools or frameworks that are more readily available in the Java ecosystem, Java may be a better choice.  In terms of performance, both Java and .NET have made significant improvements over the years, but there may still be cases where one platform outperforms the other for certain types of applications. It would be important to analyze the specific requirements and constraints of a project to determine which platform is better suited for the task at hand.  Overall, the choice between Java and .NET will depend on various factors such as the specific requirements of the project, the existing technology stack of the organization, and the expertise of the development team. Ultimately, both platforms have their strengths and weaknesses, and the decision should be based on a thorough evaluation of these factors.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "There are some language features in C# (4/5) such as LINQ, using predicate and some functional aspects that many would argue place it ahead of Java 6 in terms of productivity/flexibility (YMMV on that).  Others would argue that C# is becoming a big cesspit of every brand new idea that happens to be popular and it's getting harder to wield effectively (YMMV on that). Some will also argue that the Java eco-system is far more flexible and that the JVM is probably the most capable and flexible runtime around (if you look at the various languages that run on the JVM adn their interoperability with Java).  Again YMMV. What it really boils down to is the quality of the developer(s) who are designing and writing the code.  .NET and the Java eco-system are so close in capabilities that its usually the developer that makes a difference. From a systems integration flexibility aspect, yes Java still has an edge there.  Cross platform is still an issue - many enterprises will see using Mono as risky (again YMMV here) and there are some systems that Mono won't run on that have JVMs (Some older big IBM machines for example).  Java has also been around a bit longer and has that established 'trust' in enterprises, it's not easy for .NET to gain that trust at say a mega-bank. Meh - I conclude with no real conclusion, which I think mirrors the fact that Java and .NET are neck and neck these days. ",

I don't know that much about what specifically I'll be writing, and besides, I have fairly broad interests when it comes to code anyway. For reasons not worth discussing, my last internship had me coding only for the Java 1.3 and 1.4 SDK's.  Also, my university education has focused mainly on algorithms, data structures, and other theory, not language features or libraries. So, with the above in mind, what features, classes, etc. in the current version of Java (what number are we on now, anyway?) would be worth my time to read up on and why?  What have I missed since 1.4.2 that makes your life as a programmer easier? Examples and stories of how you discovered a particular package or some such and put it to use would also be great. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "As of now, we are currently on Java 15, with Java 16 released recently. There have been significant improvements and new features introduced in Java since version 1.4 that have made programming in Java much easier and more efficient. Some of these features include:  1. Generics: Generics were introduced in Java 5 to provide compile-time type safety and eliminate the need for explicit casting. They allow you to write code that is more reusable and type-safe.  2. Enhanced for-loop: The enhanced for-loop was introduced in Java 5, which makes iterating over collections and arrays much cleaner and easier.  3. Autoboxing and Unboxing: Autoboxing and Unboxing were introduced in Java 5, which allows automatic conversion between primitive types and their corresponding wrapper classes.  4. Enumerations: Enumerations were introduced in Java 5, which allows you to define a set of constants in a single type-safe enumeration.  5. Annotations: Annotations were introduced in Java 5, which allows you to add metadata to your code and provide additional information to the compiler.  6. Java Collections Framework: The Java Collections Framework provides a set of classes and interfaces for storing and manipulating collections of objects. It includes classes like ArrayList, HashMap, and HashSet, which make working with collections much easier.  7. Stream API: The Stream API was introduced in Java 8, which allows you to process collections of objects in a functional style. It provides a more concise and readable way to iterate over collections and perform operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing.  8. Lambda expressions: Lambda expressions were introduced in Java 8, which allows you to write more concise and readable code by treating functions as first-class objects.  9. Optional class: The Optional class was introduced in Java 8, which helps to avoid NullPointerExceptions by representing possibly-null values.  10. LocalDate/LocalTime API: The LocalDate and LocalTime APIs were introduced in Java 8, which provides a more flexible and intuitive way to work with dates and times.  I would recommend reading up on these features and familiarizing yourself with them as they will make your life as a software developer much easier. Additionally, try to explore new libraries and frameworks that have emerged since Java 1.4, such as Spring, Hibernate, and Apache Commons, as they can help streamline your development process and make your code more efficient.
