        "Question": "I am excited about the changes in PHP 6 previewed in PHP 5.3+. However, I wonder why it takes so long to release PHP 6? Books about it have been published since 2008, and announcements on it since 2007, but I am yet to hear about an alpha or a beta. Why does it take so long to release it? Or is that the way it goes with all languages when they transition to a major release where I guess it takes around 4-5 years to release? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are several reasons why it may be taking a long time to release PHP 6. One potential reason is that development on a major release like PHP 6 requires a significant amount of time and effort to ensure that it is stable, secure, and backward compatible with previous versions.   Additionally, PHP is an open-source project, meaning that development is done by a community of volunteers who may have limited time and resources to dedicate to the project. This can result in delays in the development process.  Another factor could be the complexity of the changes being made in PHP 6. Transitioning to a major release often involves making significant changes to the language and its core functionality, which can be a time-consuming process.  Overall, it is not uncommon for major releases of programming languages to take several years to develop and release. While it may be frustrating to wait for the release of PHP 6, it is important to remember that the development team is working hard to ensure that the release is of high quality and meets the needs of the community.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "The release timetable is not unusual for languages, and it's not even that unusual for PHP: 5.0 was released in 2004, but 4.0 was released in 2000.  Compare this to the last stable releases for C (2000), Fortran (2003), or C++ (2003). One other thing to keep in mind is that 5.3 was a major release in all but name. It adds a lot of stuff that was originally destined for PHP 6. Due to development problems with unicode support (a major part of PHP 6), it was decided to release what was stable at the time as a 5.x branch. ",

        "Question": "There's around a zillion \"PHP frameworks\". And most of them bill themselves as following the MVC pattern. While it's welcome to overcome osCommerce coding style (processing logic heavily intermixed with SQL and HTML), there are certainly simpler and easier to follow approaches to get a maintainable application design. The original MVC concept was targetted at GUI applications. And for Gtk/Python it seems feasible to follow it accordingly. But PHP web apps don't operate on live Views (GUI elements) and a persistent Controller runtime. It's quite certainly a misnomer if it just describes the used code + directory grouping or class naming. \"MVC\" seems to be used like a buzzword for PHP frameworks. And I've actually seen one or two mature PHP frameworks admit it, but redefining the phrase anyway to match interna. So is it generally snake oil? Why isn't better terminology used, and a more sensible concept for maintainable PHP propagated? Some elaborative reasoning Why I suspect that PHP implementations don't follow the real MVC pattern: Models: in theory, Models should be fat and contain business logic, and controllers should be thin handlers (input->output). In reality the PHP frameworks advocate shallow Models. CI and Symfony for example equate Model == ORM. Even HTTP input is handled by the controller, isn't treated as model. Views: workarounds with AJAX discounted, there can't be Views on web pages. PHP frameworks still pump out pages. The interface still effectively follows the ordinary HTTP model, there's no advantage over non-MVC applications. (And lastly, none of the widespread php frameworks can factually output to GUI Views instead of HTML. I've seen a PHP library that can operate Gtk/Console/Web, but the frameworks don't.) Controller: I'm unsure. Controllers probably don't need to be long-running and persistently active in the MVC model. In PHP framework context, they're however mostly request handlers. Not really something to get argumentative about, but it just feels slightly buzzwordish. Would there be better descriptors? I've seen acronyms like PMVC or HMVC thrown around. Though descriptions get more ambigous there, maybe these would describe the current web frameworks less hokey? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "While it's true that many PHP frameworks claim to follow the MVC pattern, the reality is that most of them don't actually adhere to the true principles of MVC. Models are often treated as simple ORM classes, Views are still essentially HTML pages, and Controllers are primarily request handlers rather than true intermediary components.   The use of the term \"MVC\" has indeed become somewhat of a buzzword in the PHP community, with frameworks using it primarily for marketing purposes rather than accurately representing the architecture of their applications.   It would be beneficial for the PHP community to adopt more accurate terminology and concepts for designing maintainable applications. Acronyms like PMVC or HMVC have been suggested as alternatives, but there is still a lack of consensus on what these terms actually mean and how they should be implemented.   In conclusion, while the concept of MVC may not be fully realized in many PHP frameworks, there is certainly room for improvement in the way that developers approach application design and architecture. It's important to look beyond buzzwords and focus on creating clear, maintainable code that follows sound architectural principles.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": " But PHP web apps don't operate on live Views (GUI elements) and a persistent Controller runtime.   No, they sure do! Think of AJAX applications, then the view asks something to the controller and gets a partial view back, this view or data is then filled in somewhere in the page and thus live updated. The Controller is also persistent because you can use cookies/sessions.  \"MVC\" seems to be used like a buzzword for PHP frameworks.  MVC is a Software Architecture, some frameworks might use it as a buzz, but others do it properly... See a list of some frameworks on Wikipedia.  is MVC just the SEO of php programming?  MVC and SEO are two things apart, but yes... MVC is getting more popular. ",
