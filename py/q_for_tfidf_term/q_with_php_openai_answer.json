        "Question": "I am excited about the changes in PHP 6 previewed in PHP 5.3+. However, I wonder why it takes so long to release PHP 6? Books about it have been published since 2008, and announcements on it since 2007, but I am yet to hear about an alpha or a beta. Why does it take so long to release it? Or is that the way it goes with all languages when they transition to a major release where I guess it takes around 4-5 years to release? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "The delay in the release of PHP 6 can be attributed to various factors. One major reason is the complexity of the changes being implemented in this version. The PHP core team has been working on significant improvements and new features, such as Unicode support and the removal of deprecated features, which require thorough testing and refinement to ensure they work effectively and do not break existing code.  Another factor contributing to the delay could be resource constraints. Developing a programming language like PHP requires a lot of time, effort, and expertise, and the core team may be limited in terms of manpower and resources.  Additionally, the PHP community plays a crucial role in the development process by providing feedback, testing new features, and contributing to the codebase. This collaborative approach can sometimes slow down the release timeline as the team works to address feedback and incorporate community contributions.  Overall, the delay in releasing PHP 6 is likely a combination of the complexity of the changes being made, resource constraints, and the collaborative nature of open-source development. While the wait may be frustrating for some, it is essential for ensuring that the new version of PHP meets the needs of developers and maintains compatibility with existing codebases.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "The release timetable is not unusual for languages, and it's not even that unusual for PHP: 5.0 was released in 2004, but 4.0 was released in 2000.  Compare this to the last stable releases for C (2000), Fortran (2003), or C++ (2003). One other thing to keep in mind is that 5.3 was a major release in all but name. It adds a lot of stuff that was originally destined for PHP 6. Due to development problems with unicode support (a major part of PHP 6), it was decided to release what was stable at the time as a 5.x branch. ",

        "Question": "There's around a zillion \"PHP frameworks\". And most of them bill themselves as following the MVC pattern. While it's welcome to overcome osCommerce coding style (processing logic heavily intermixed with SQL and HTML), there are certainly simpler and easier to follow approaches to get a maintainable application design. The original MVC concept was targetted at GUI applications. And for Gtk/Python it seems feasible to follow it accordingly. But PHP web apps don't operate on live Views (GUI elements) and a persistent Controller runtime. It's quite certainly a misnomer if it just describes the used code + directory grouping or class naming. \"MVC\" seems to be used like a buzzword for PHP frameworks. And I've actually seen one or two mature PHP frameworks admit it, but redefining the phrase anyway to match interna. So is it generally snake oil? Why isn't better terminology used, and a more sensible concept for maintainable PHP propagated? Some elaborative reasoning Why I suspect that PHP implementations don't follow the real MVC pattern: Models: in theory, Models should be fat and contain business logic, and controllers should be thin handlers (input->output). In reality the PHP frameworks advocate shallow Models. CI and Symfony for example equate Model == ORM. Even HTTP input is handled by the controller, isn't treated as model. Views: workarounds with AJAX discounted, there can't be Views on web pages. PHP frameworks still pump out pages. The interface still effectively follows the ordinary HTTP model, there's no advantage over non-MVC applications. (And lastly, none of the widespread php frameworks can factually output to GUI Views instead of HTML. I've seen a PHP library that can operate Gtk/Console/Web, but the frameworks don't.) Controller: I'm unsure. Controllers probably don't need to be long-running and persistently active in the MVC model. In PHP framework context, they're however mostly request handlers. Not really something to get argumentative about, but it just feels slightly buzzwordish. Would there be better descriptors? I've seen acronyms like PMVC or HMVC thrown around. Though descriptions get more ambigous there, maybe these would describe the current web frameworks less hokey? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It's true that many PHP frameworks claim to follow the MVC pattern, but in reality, their implementation may not fully adhere to the original concept of MVC as it was intended for GUI applications. In PHP web applications, there are some key differences that make it challenging to strictly follow the traditional MVC pattern.  One issue is with the Models in PHP frameworks, which tend to be thin and focused on data retrieval using ORM, rather than containing business logic. This can lead to a violation of the separation of concerns principle that MVC aims to uphold. Similarly, the handling of HTTP input in controllers rather than in the model can also blur the lines between the different components of the MVC pattern.  Furthermore, in web applications, the concept of Views can be challenging to implement in a true sense due to the nature of HTTP and HTML. While some frameworks may try to work around this limitation with AJAX, the core idea of GUI Views in the traditional MVC pattern doesn't translate directly to web pages.  As for Controllers, their role in PHP frameworks may be more focused on request handling rather than the input-output logic as intended in the original MVC pattern. This can contribute to the feeling that the MVC pattern is being used as a buzzword rather than a true implementation in PHP frameworks.  Considering these challenges, it may be more beneficial to explore alternative patterns or descriptors that better suit the nature of PHP web applications. Concepts like PMVC or HMVC offer different perspectives on how to structure web applications, and they may provide a more practical and sensible approach for maintainable PHP code. Ultimately, it's important to consider the specific requirements and constraints of web development when choosing a design pattern or framework, rather than sticking rigidly to a traditional concept that may not be the best fit for the task at hand.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": " But PHP web apps don't operate on live Views (GUI elements) and a persistent Controller runtime.   No, they sure do! Think of AJAX applications, then the view asks something to the controller and gets a partial view back, this view or data is then filled in somewhere in the page and thus live updated. The Controller is also persistent because you can use cookies/sessions.  \"MVC\" seems to be used like a buzzword for PHP frameworks.  MVC is a Software Architecture, some frameworks might use it as a buzz, but others do it properly... See a list of some frameworks on Wikipedia.  is MVC just the SEO of php programming?  MVC and SEO are two things apart, but yes... MVC is getting more popular. ",
