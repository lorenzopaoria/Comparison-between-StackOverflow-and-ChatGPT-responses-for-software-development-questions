        "Question": "i wonder apart from those very simple hello world apps, what other programs should i try developing for learning. i am entering uni next year and wonder what kind of programs will be developed in that environment.  this is not really a language specific thing, but if you want to know what i use currently mainly  windows: C#/WPF - i studied java/vb etc in poly but i think C# is the way to go, maybe even F# web: PHP/MySQL, Zend Framework/Doctrine, + HTML/CSS/JS(jQuery) of course. looking to try google app engine with python too.   for now, i am thinking of   todo lists apps that integrate with api eg. twitter/tumblr which i use text editor - i am currently trying to develop a text editor that uses markdown and generates html files for viewing (link to blog entry). not very pratical after i started developing it. cos when editing theres no formatting and in HTML format, i cannot edit directly  blog software (for web)  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Some other program ideas you could try developing for learning purposes include:  1. A budgeting app that tracks expenses and income 2. A weather app that pulls data from an API and displays it in a user-friendly way 3. A recipe app that allows users to search for and save their favorite recipes 4. A task management app with features like due dates, reminders, and project organization 5. A social media scheduling app that allows users to schedule posts across multiple platforms 6. A workout tracking app that logs exercises, sets, and reps 7. A music player app with features like playlists, shuffle, and repeat options 8. A quiz app that tests users on various topics and tracks their scores 9. A note-taking app that organizes notes by category and allows for easy searching and editing 10. A language learning app that helps users study vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.  These projects will help you gain experience with a variety of tools and techniques that will be useful in your university studies and future career in software development. Good luck with your programming journey!",

        "Question": "Often when stating a new project I'll require a \"quick 'n' dirty\" content management solution. Ideally something that can read my database schema and generated HTML forms. Previously I've used; phpMyEdit and phpMyAdmin but they are lacking is key areas. My wish list woulds be:  Database independent Foreign key aware Handles views as-well-as tables Generates modern HTML and CSS AJAX interface.  What's your swiss army knife when it comes to CMS on a project? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One suggestion for a versatile CMS that meets your requirements is Drupal. Drupal is a popular open-source framework that is database-independent, supports foreign keys, and can handle both tables and views. It also has a theme system that allows you to easily generate modern HTML and CSS for your website. Additionally, Drupal has a wide range of modules available that can add AJAX functionality to your site, making it a powerful and flexible option for your project.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I think you're looking for \"scaffolding\", where the software generates views that allow users to maintain the data without you having to do much or any work.  If you must stick with PHP, then look at CakePHP. http://book.cakephp.org/view/105/Scaffolding But two quick suggestions for you. Look at this site: http://www.phpscaffold.com/ Second suggestion: Consider switching to Python/Django or Ruby on Rails.  Both of those are better than what PHP has to offer in terms of scaffolding.  There may be something in PHP somewhere that's as good, but I have not seen it.  CakePHP is the closest I know of. ",

        "Question": "I had a question posed to me the other day by another programmer.  I remember (a very long time ago) wondering the very same.  Why was a browser-side include tag never considered?  Or was it? Specifically with a tag that instructed the browser to include additional HTML from other sources. e.g. <include src=\"http://server/foo/bar.html\">.  Many folks will make javascript calls and fill innerHTML to accomplish the same, when the same outside a the javascript engine could be accomplished by the browser. It would have been painful to have nested <HTML>s <BODY>s (i.e.) but we have to consider that aspect anywhere anyway. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "The idea of a browser-side include tag has actually been considered in the past, but it never gained widespread adoption for a few reasons.   One reason is security concerns. Allowing a browser to include external HTML content opens up the possibility of cross-site scripting attacks, where malicious code could be injected into a website through the included content.   Another reason is that it could potentially slow down a webpage's loading time. If a webpage had multiple include tags pointing to different sources, each of these includes would have to be fetched separately, potentially causing delays in rendering the page.   Additionally, the use of client-side includes could lead to accessibility issues for users with disabilities who rely on assistive technologies to navigate the web.   Overall, while the idea of a browser-side include tag has been considered, it has not been widely adopted due to security, performance, and accessibility concerns.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": " Why was a browser-side include tag never considered? Or was it?  It was certainly requested by every newbie web author who hadn't worked out Server Side Includes yet, back in the early days on the www-html list. But in those days W3 were happy to completely ignore web author pressure. If cross-site inclusion were allowed it would be a security disaster. You could pull in a page from the user's bank and read content from it. (Originally, DOM scripting was limited, but you could still have read from document.links, document.images, scripting functions dropped by the target page, etc. Since then you can do what you like with imported content.) If cross-site inclusion weren't allowed... well then the feature wouldn't have any advantage over server-side includes. It'd be more, slower work for the client to do that the server could have dealt with better. Unlike <iframe>, an include would have to block page loading. SSIs would be in every way superior. ",

        "Question": "I realized I have to write down a convention specification about HTML, JavaScript and PHP coding for me and my team. In web development, just like in C++, I'm definitely a fan of indentation and comments. Nonetheless, often in my work I encounter HTML+JavaScript+PHP code which suddenly brings up the headache. I'm trying to make my code readable, but what seems to be better to me (to indent & comment) seems not to fascinate my teammates, so I was wondering if there is a best or at least shared good practice when writing \"hybrid\" documents just like today's web pages, which day by day become more and more complex.  I'm aware of the fact that probably it is in the nature of today's web pages' code to be a little bit intricated, but I wonder if a good convention concerning these aspects already exists. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One common convention for writing readable and maintainable code in HTML, JavaScript, and PHP is to follow the principles of clean code and coding standards. Here are some guidelines that can help you and your team write better code:  1. Indentation: Use consistent indentation to make your code more readable. This can help to visually separate different blocks of code and make it easier to understand the structure of the code.  2. Comments: Use comments to explain the purpose of sections of code, especially complex or non-obvious logic. Comments can help team members understand your code and make it easier to maintain in the future.  3. Naming conventions: Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes. This can help to make your code more self-documenting and easier to understand.  4. Code organization: Organize your code into logical sections and group related functions and variables together. This can help to improve the maintainability of your code and make it easier to navigate.  5. Use consistent coding style: Agree on a consistent coding style with your team members and stick to it. This can help to ensure that all code written by team members follows the same conventions and is easier to read and maintain.  6. Avoid excessive nesting: Try to avoid excessive nesting of loops and conditional statements, as this can make your code harder to understand. Consider refactoring your code to reduce nesting levels and simplify the logic.  By following these guidelines and establishing a common convention with your team, you can improve the readability and maintainability of your HTML, JavaScript, and PHP code. This can help to ensure that your code is easier to work with and understand, even as it becomes more complex.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Some general rules I follow: General  Indents are 4 spaces. Indent new levels Comments are < ~80 chars from the indent level. If I'm in two levels (8 spaces) that means the cursor stop will be around 88 characters.  Use multi-line comments. I prefer the look, however this is a subjective point. Comment now rather then later when you have no idea what's going on. Allman style braces. It's cleaner and is more readable. Subjective.  JavaScript  Use a library. jQuery in particular is very good. It eliminates all cross browser headaches. Understand that ID's are for particular elements, classes are for styles. ID's shouldn't be used more then once per page and they will have particular hooks attached to them. Use classes for things like navigation. Out source into methods. It's tempting to put all the code into the bind call, however putting it in it's own function will increase the flexibility of your code. Use functions instead of evals. That means setTimeout(function(){ /* Do something */ }, 1000); instead of setTimeout('doSomething', 1000); Use local variables with var.   HTML  Semantic markup. Use appropriate tags. Don't put <br />'s in there to add space, adjust margins and CSS rules. All tags are lowercase. All tags should end with a closing tag or be self closing. Make use of classes for layout that is similar. Have a couple of predefined classes like hide, clear, error, etc. Everything (scripts included) should go in <head>. Worry about optimizing (moving stuff around) when it presents a problem. External stylesheets and JavaScript source is a must unless it is page specific.  PHP  Frameworks are good, I recommend CodeIgniter. If you don't want to use a framework, try to use the latest version of PHP possible. (That means 5.3). Use includes to your advantage.  Clear injections or use prepared statements. Perform if checks on preconceived fail-secure values. $logged_in = false; if(check_user($user)) {      $logged_in = true;      $user = load_user($_SESSION); }  Know the difference between single and double quotes. Use single quotes when possible. Don't echo HTML.  ",

        "Question": "What I am looking for is the most optimal solution for storing content revisions in an MSSQL database. We have an application that allows users to make changes to small HTML content blocks similar to a wiki, but we need to have tight audit control over the changes. At any point in time, the manager might want to look at previously submitted contents or revert the entire HTML block back to the previous state. I had it setup in the past where we had a primary table that stored the HTML information (along with various other meta tags) and then an audit table that kept a copy of the entire data row everytime a change was made. What I am wondering is if this is the best way to go, or should I just keep 1 table with all the current records and the changes in it and just have a flag that lets me know which one is the current one? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Both approaches you mentioned have their own set of benefits and trade-offs. Here are some considerations for each approach that might help you decide which one is the best fit for your specific use case:  1. Two-table approach: - Pros:   - Clear separation of current and historical data, making it easier to query and analyze changes over time.   - Audit table can hold a full history of revisions without cluttering the main table with unnecessary data.   - Having separate tables can make it easier to maintain data integrity and enforce constraints.  - Cons:   - Requires additional database schema design and potentially more complex queries to retrieve historical data.   - May result in duplicate data storage if the HTML content blocks are large.   - Possibility of inconsistencies if updates are not properly synchronized between the main and audit tables.  2. Single table with a flag: - Pros:   - Simpler database schema and queries since all data is stored in one table.   - Potentially better performance for retrieving current data as historical records are not stored separately.   - Easier to maintain data consistency as all updates are done in one place.  - Cons:   - Historical revisions may clutter the main table and make it harder to differentiate current from past versions.   - Lack of clear separation between current and historical data could make it more challenging to analyze changes over time.   - Updates to historical records may overwrite the current data if not properly managed.  Ultimately, the best approach for storing content revisions will depend on factors such as the size and complexity of the HTML content blocks, the frequency of revisions, the importance of maintaining a clear audit trail, and the performance requirements of your application. You may also want to consider implementing a combination of both approaches or exploring other database features such as triggers or version control systems to further optimize your solution.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I have had decent success with doing a bit of both. One table that has the current version of the record and one table with every version (and a timestamp and an edited by) in another table. This gives you the advantage of having a complete copy of each version without the overhead of having to sort out the current version from all the others at runtime.  it also allows you to set much stricter permissions on the audit table and optionally implement the audit copy with triggers and completely hide the audit information from the rest of the app if you like that sort of thing.

        "Question": "It seems like most of the jobs I'm receiving, and most of the Internet, is still using standard HTML (HTML 4, let's say) + CSS + JS. Does anyone have any vision on where HTML5 is as a standard, particularly regarding acceptance and diffusion? It's easy to find information about inconsistencies between implementations of HTML5 and so forth. What I want to know about is relevance of HTML5. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "HTML5 has been widely adopted and is now the standard for web development. Most modern websites are built using HTML5 along with CSS and JavaScript. HTML5 offers new features and improvements over previous versions, such as improved multimedia support, canvas element for drawing graphics, local storage capabilities, and better integration with CSS and JavaScript.  In terms of acceptance and diffusion, HTML5 has become the de facto standard for web development. It is supported by all major browsers and web development tools, making it easy for developers to create advanced and interactive websites. Many new web technologies and frameworks are built on top of HTML5, further solidifying its relevance in the industry.  While there may still be some inconsistencies between implementations of HTML5, these issues are being addressed by browser vendors and the W3C standards group. Overall, HTML5 is a highly relevant and important standard for web development, and developers should continue to learn and utilize its features in their work.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I'd say definitely get in there and start learning some of the technologies involved.  Just be aware that 'HTML 5' right now is actually really a marketing term! HTML 5 has not been ratified as a standard yet and although all of the major players are throwing their support behind 'HTML 5' they're all actually just implementing bits a pieces of various specs including ECMA script (Java script), CSS, HTML and a whole lot more that I'm not qualified to talk about. MS for example released IE9 beta to great fanfare in San Fran, highlighting their awesome HTML 5 support.  Naturally their IE/GPU enhanced lovely demos didn't quite work so nice on other 'HTML 5' browsers such as the latest Chrome of FF Beta or Opera. So, um yeah, don't delay in starting to investigate - MS is banking on it heavily (even though they have their Silverlight platform) and I bet you'll see Adobe hedging their bets in the next few years as well. For production websites that users will use tomorrow?  Um don't use 'HTML 5' yet. ",
