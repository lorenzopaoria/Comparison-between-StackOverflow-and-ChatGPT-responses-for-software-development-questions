        "Question": "i wonder apart from those very simple hello world apps, what other programs should i try developing for learning. i am entering uni next year and wonder what kind of programs will be developed in that environment.  this is not really a language specific thing, but if you want to know what i use currently mainly  windows: C#/WPF - i studied java/vb etc in poly but i think C# is the way to go, maybe even F# web: PHP/MySQL, Zend Framework/Doctrine, + HTML/CSS/JS(jQuery) of course. looking to try google app engine with python too.   for now, i am thinking of   todo lists apps that integrate with api eg. twitter/tumblr which i use text editor - i am currently trying to develop a text editor that uses markdown and generates html files for viewing (link to blog entry). not very pratical after i started developing it. cos when editing theres no formatting and in HTML format, i cannot edit directly  blog software (for web)  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Some other ideas for programs you could try developing to learn more would be:  1. A social media management tool that allows users to schedule posts, track engagement, and analyze data from multiple platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  2. A budget tracking app that allows users to input expenses and income, set financial goals, and view reports on their spending habits.  3. A recipe organizer that allows users to save and categorize their favorite recipes, create shopping lists, and share them with others.  4. A workout tracker that allows users to input their daily exercise routines, track progress, and set goals for weight loss or muscle gain.  5. An event planning app that helps users organize and manage events such as parties, weddings, or conferences, including guest lists, invitations, and budget tracking.  By working on these types of projects, you will gain practical experience in developing software that has real-world applications and can be valuable in a university or professional setting. Good luck with your programming journey!",
