        "Question": "i wonder apart from those very simple hello world apps, what other programs should i try developing for learning. i am entering uni next year and wonder what kind of programs will be developed in that environment.  this is not really a language specific thing, but if you want to know what i use currently mainly  windows: C#/WPF - i studied java/vb etc in poly but i think C# is the way to go, maybe even F# web: PHP/MySQL, Zend Framework/Doctrine, + HTML/CSS/JS(jQuery) of course. looking to try google app engine with python too.   for now, i am thinking of   todo lists apps that integrate with api eg. twitter/tumblr which i use text editor - i am currently trying to develop a text editor that uses markdown and generates html files for viewing (link to blog entry). not very pratical after i started developing it. cos when editing theres no formatting and in HTML format, i cannot edit directly  blog software (for web)  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Some other program ideas you can try developing for learning could include:  1. A weather app that pulls data from a weather API and displays current weather conditions and forecasts. 2. A social media app that allows users to create and share posts, follow friends, and comment on posts. 3. A task management app that helps users organize their daily tasks, set reminders, and track completion progress. 4. A recipe app that allows users to search for recipes, create meal plans, and generate grocery lists. 5. A budgeting app that helps users track their expenses, create budgets, and analyze spending habits. 6. An e-commerce website that allows users to browse products, add items to a cart, and complete purchases. 7. A messaging app that allows users to send and receive messages, create group chats, and share media. 8. A workout tracker app that helps users log their workouts, set fitness goals, and track progress over time. 9. A music player app that allows users to create playlists, shuffle songs, and customize the user interface. 10. A gaming app that includes features like leaderboards, achievements, and multiplayer capabilities.   These are just some ideas to get you started, but feel free to explore different types of programs and technologies to broaden your skillset. Good luck with your learning journey!",
