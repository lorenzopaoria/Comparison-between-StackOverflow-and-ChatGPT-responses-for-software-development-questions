        "Question": "At first glance, I'd say a good programming team needs to understand the following matters:  The details of the core language / framework HTML, (asynchronous) javascript SQL / data model Usability / UI design Security Project management.  If this team is not complete: what is needed? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "If the programming team is not complete, some additional roles that could be beneficial include a designer for creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces, a cybersecurity expert to ensure the security of the project, a data scientist for analyzing and interpreting data, and a quality assurance tester for ensuring the functionality and performance of the software. Additionally, project managers with strong leadership and communication skills can help coordinate the team and ensure project deadlines are met.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Customer (or an advocate of some sort).   Basically, someone that can say, \"Yes, you're building what I want and it's going to solve my problem.\" or that the team can go to when they have questions about how something is supposed to work.  That may or may not be the same person that is doing Project Management. Also, you're missing out on a QA person there.  You can't really depend on the developers to adequately test - they're usually too close to the code and the normal response for developers is to test happy path stuff, not doing weird crap like copy pasting War & Peace into a textbox and seeing what the application does.

        "Question": "i wonder apart from those very simple hello world apps, what other programs should i try developing for learning. i am entering uni next year and wonder what kind of programs will be developed in that environment.  this is not really a language specific thing, but if you want to know what i use currently mainly  windows: C#/WPF - i studied java/vb etc in poly but i think C# is the way to go, maybe even F# web: PHP/MySQL, Zend Framework/Doctrine, + HTML/CSS/JS(jQuery) of course. looking to try google app engine with python too.   for now, i am thinking of   todo lists apps that integrate with api eg. twitter/tumblr which i use text editor - i am currently trying to develop a text editor that uses markdown and generates html files for viewing (link to blog entry). not very pratical after i started developing it. cos when editing theres no formatting and in HTML format, i cannot edit directly  blog software (for web)  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Some ideas for programs you could try developing to enhance your skills could include:  1. A simple game - this could be a traditional text-based game or a more complex game using a game development framework like Unity.  2. A music player or streaming app - this could involve working with audio files, creating playlists, and integrating with streaming services.  3. A weather app - you could pull in weather data from an API and display it in a user-friendly interface.  4. A social media dashboard - this could involve integrating with multiple social media APIs to display posts, updates, and notifications in one place.  5. A budgeting or expense tracking app - this could involve creating a way for users to input and track their expenses, generate reports, and set budgets.  6. A task management app - this could involve creating a way for users to input tasks, set deadlines, and track their progress.  These projects will not only help you learn new skills and technologies, but they will also give you experience working on more complex programs that will be valuable in a university setting. Good luck with your programming journey!",

        "Question": "Often when stating a new project I'll require a \"quick 'n' dirty\" content management solution. Ideally something that can read my database schema and generated HTML forms. Previously I've used; phpMyEdit and phpMyAdmin but they are lacking is key areas. My wish list woulds be:  Database independent Foreign key aware Handles views as-well-as tables Generates modern HTML and CSS AJAX interface.  What's your swiss army knife when it comes to CMS on a project? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One tool that might meet your criteria is PHP Grid Framework. It is a flexible and extensible PHP library that can generate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interfaces for database tables. It supports a wide range of databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.   Another option to consider is Laravel Nova, which is a powerful administration panel for Laravel applications. It provides a highly customizable interface for managing database resources and relationships, and can also generate HTML forms based on your database schema.  Lastly, if you prefer a more lightweight solution, you may want to look into Adminer. It is a single PHP file that provides a simple and user-friendly interface for managing databases. While it may not have all the features you are looking for, it can be a quick and easy way to interact with your database during the development process.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I think you're looking for \"scaffolding\", where the software generates views that allow users to maintain the data without you having to do much or any work.  If you must stick with PHP, then look at CakePHP. http://book.cakephp.org/view/105/Scaffolding But two quick suggestions for you. Look at this site: http://www.phpscaffold.com/ Second suggestion: Consider switching to Python/Django or Ruby on Rails.  Both of those are better than what PHP has to offer in terms of scaffolding.  There may be something in PHP somewhere that's as good, but I have not seen it.  CakePHP is the closest I know of. ",

        "Question": "I had a question posed to me the other day by another programmer.  I remember (a very long time ago) wondering the very same.  Why was a browser-side include tag never considered?  Or was it? Specifically with a tag that instructed the browser to include additional HTML from other sources. e.g. <include src=\"http://server/foo/bar.html\">.  Many folks will make javascript calls and fill innerHTML to accomplish the same, when the same outside a the javascript engine could be accomplished by the browser. It would have been painful to have nested <HTML>s <BODY>s (i.e.) but we have to consider that aspect anywhere anyway. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "The idea of a browser-side include tag has actually been considered in the past, but ultimately was not widely adopted for a few reasons. One of the main concerns is security - allowing the browser to fetch and include code from external sources could potentially expose users to security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting attacks.  Another reason is that modern web development practices have shifted towards using more dynamic and interactive techniques, such as AJAX calls and server-side includes, which can accomplish similar goals without the need for a specific browser-side include tag.  That being said, there are still debates within the web development community about the potential benefits and drawbacks of a browser-side include tag. It's possible that in the future, new standards or technologies may emerge that make this concept more feasible and practical.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": " Why was a browser-side include tag never considered? Or was it?  It was certainly requested by every newbie web author who hadn't worked out Server Side Includes yet, back in the early days on the www-html list. But in those days W3 were happy to completely ignore web author pressure. If cross-site inclusion were allowed it would be a security disaster. You could pull in a page from the user's bank and read content from it. (Originally, DOM scripting was limited, but you could still have read from document.links, document.images, scripting functions dropped by the target page, etc. Since then you can do what you like with imported content.) If cross-site inclusion weren't allowed... well then the feature wouldn't have any advantage over server-side includes. It'd be more, slower work for the client to do that the server could have dealt with better. Unlike <iframe>, an include would have to block page loading. SSIs would be in every way superior. ",
