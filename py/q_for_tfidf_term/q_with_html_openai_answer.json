        "Question": "i wonder apart from those very simple hello world apps, what other programs should i try developing for learning. i am entering uni next year and wonder what kind of programs will be developed in that environment.  this is not really a language specific thing, but if you want to know what i use currently mainly  windows: C#/WPF - i studied java/vb etc in poly but i think C# is the way to go, maybe even F# web: PHP/MySQL, Zend Framework/Doctrine, + HTML/CSS/JS(jQuery) of course. looking to try google app engine with python too.   for now, i am thinking of   todo lists apps that integrate with api eg. twitter/tumblr which i use text editor - i am currently trying to develop a text editor that uses markdown and generates html files for viewing (link to blog entry). not very pratical after i started developing it. cos when editing theres no formatting and in HTML format, i cannot edit directly  blog software (for web)  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "In addition to the programs you mentioned, here are a few more ideas for projects you could try developing to further enhance your skills and prepare for uni:  - A social media management tool that allows users to schedule posts across multiple platforms, analyze engagement metrics, and track growth over time. - A job board platform that connects job seekers with relevant opportunities, allows companies to post job listings, and includes features such as resume building tools and application tracking. - An e-commerce platform with features such as inventory management, order processing, and customer tracking. - A project management tool that helps teams collaborate on tasks, set deadlines, track progress, and communicate effectively. - A recipe app that allows users to search for, save, and share recipes, create shopping lists, and customize recipes based on dietary restrictions or preferences.  These projects can help you gain experience in developing more complex software applications and familiarize yourself with the kind of projects you may encounter in a university setting. Good luck with your programming journey!",
