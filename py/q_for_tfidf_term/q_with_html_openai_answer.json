        "Question": "i wonder apart from those very simple hello world apps, what other programs should i try developing for learning. i am entering uni next year and wonder what kind of programs will be developed in that environment.  this is not really a language specific thing, but if you want to know what i use currently mainly  windows: C#/WPF - i studied java/vb etc in poly but i think C# is the way to go, maybe even F# web: PHP/MySQL, Zend Framework/Doctrine, + HTML/CSS/JS(jQuery) of course. looking to try google app engine with python too.   for now, i am thinking of   todo lists apps that integrate with api eg. twitter/tumblr which i use text editor - i am currently trying to develop a text editor that uses markdown and generates html files for viewing (link to blog entry). not very pratical after i started developing it. cos when editing theres no formatting and in HTML format, i cannot edit directly  blog software (for web)  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Some other program ideas you could try developing for learning purposes include:  1. An e-commerce website: You could create a fully functional online shopping website with features such as user authentication, product browsing and searching, cart management, and checkout processes.  2. A social networking platform: Create a small-scale social networking platform where users can create profiles, connect with friends, share updates, and send messages.  3. A weather app: Develop an app that pulls in real-time weather data from a weather API and displays it in a user-friendly interface.  4. A chatbot: Create a chatbot using natural language processing techniques that can interact with users and provide information or assistance.  5. A project management tool: Create a project management tool that allows users to create projects, assign tasks, track progress, and collaborate with team members.  These projects will not only help you improve your programming skills but also give you valuable experience working on real-world applications that you may encounter in a university or professional setting. Good luck with your coding journey!",

        "Question": "Often when stating a new project I'll require a \"quick 'n' dirty\" content management solution. Ideally something that can read my database schema and generated HTML forms. Previously I've used; phpMyEdit and phpMyAdmin but they are lacking is key areas. My wish list woulds be:  Database independent Foreign key aware Handles views as-well-as tables Generates modern HTML and CSS AJAX interface.  What's your swiss army knife when it comes to CMS on a project? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One popular option for a quick and easy content management solution that meets many of your requirements is WordPress. WordPress is a versatile platform that can be easily customized and expanded with plugins to handle a wide range of functionalities. It has a user-friendly interface, and there are many themes available that can generate modern HTML and CSS for your site. Additionally, there are plugins available that can handle foreign keys, and there are advanced plugins that can handle database views as well.  Another option to consider is Drupal, which is a powerful and flexible content management system that is also database-independent and can handle complex data structures. Drupal has a large community of developers and a wide range of modules available to extend its functionality. Like WordPress, Drupal can be customized to generate modern HTML and CSS, and there are modules available that can handle foreign keys and database views.  Ultimately, the best choice for a CMS will depend on the specific requirements of your project and your level of expertise with different systems. Both WordPress and Drupal are popular options that can handle a wide range of projects, and they offer flexibility and scalability for future growth.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I think you're looking for \"scaffolding\", where the software generates views that allow users to maintain the data without you having to do much or any work.  If you must stick with PHP, then look at CakePHP. http://book.cakephp.org/view/105/Scaffolding But two quick suggestions for you. Look at this site: http://www.phpscaffold.com/ Second suggestion: Consider switching to Python/Django or Ruby on Rails.  Both of those are better than what PHP has to offer in terms of scaffolding.  There may be something in PHP somewhere that's as good, but I have not seen it.  CakePHP is the closest I know of. ",

        "Question": "I had a question posed to me the other day by another programmer.  I remember (a very long time ago) wondering the very same.  Why was a browser-side include tag never considered?  Or was it? Specifically with a tag that instructed the browser to include additional HTML from other sources. e.g. <include src=\"http://server/foo/bar.html\">.  Many folks will make javascript calls and fill innerHTML to accomplish the same, when the same outside a the javascript engine could be accomplished by the browser. It would have been painful to have nested <HTML>s <BODY>s (i.e.) but we have to consider that aspect anywhere anyway. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "The idea of a browser-side include tag has been considered in the past, and there have been discussions about it within the web development community. One reason why it may not have gained widespread adoption is due to security concerns. Allowing the browser to fetch and include external HTML files could potentially open up security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting attacks.  Additionally, the web development community has largely moved towards using JavaScript and AJAX to dynamically load content into web pages. This allows for more flexibility and control over the content being included, as well as the ability to manipulate it before inserting it into the page.  That being said, there have been proposals for similar features, such as the <iframe> tag which allows for including external content within a web page. However, these features are typically used for embedding content from other sources, rather than including additional HTML from the same domain.  Overall, while the idea of a browser-side include tag has been considered, it may not have been widely adopted due to security concerns and the increasing use of JavaScript for dynamic content loading.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": " Why was a browser-side include tag never considered? Or was it?  It was certainly requested by every newbie web author who hadn't worked out Server Side Includes yet, back in the early days on the www-html list. But in those days W3 were happy to completely ignore web author pressure. If cross-site inclusion were allowed it would be a security disaster. You could pull in a page from the user's bank and read content from it. (Originally, DOM scripting was limited, but you could still have read from document.links, document.images, scripting functions dropped by the target page, etc. Since then you can do what you like with imported content.) If cross-site inclusion weren't allowed... well then the feature wouldn't have any advantage over server-side includes. It'd be more, slower work for the client to do that the server could have dealt with better. Unlike <iframe>, an include would have to block page loading. SSIs would be in every way superior. ",

        "Question": "I realized I have to write down a convention specification about HTML, JavaScript and PHP coding for me and my team. In web development, just like in C++, I'm definitely a fan of indentation and comments. Nonetheless, often in my work I encounter HTML+JavaScript+PHP code which suddenly brings up the headache. I'm trying to make my code readable, but what seems to be better to me (to indent & comment) seems not to fascinate my teammates, so I was wondering if there is a best or at least shared good practice when writing \"hybrid\" documents just like today's web pages, which day by day become more and more complex.  I'm aware of the fact that probably it is in the nature of today's web pages' code to be a little bit intricated, but I wonder if a good convention concerning these aspects already exists. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One common convention that is widely used in web development is to separate HTML, JavaScript, and PHP code into different files. This helps to improve readability and maintainability of the code. Additionally, consider using a code linter or formatter tool to enforce consistent formatting and coding style across the team.  When it comes to indentation and comments, it's always a good practice to use them consistently in your code. Indentation helps to visually organize the code and make it easier to understand the structure, while comments provide additional context or explanations for the code.  In terms of commenting, you can consider using inline comments to explain specific parts of the code, as well as block comments to provide an overview of larger sections of code. Make sure to keep the comments up-to-date with any changes made to the code.  Overall, it's important to have open communication with your team about coding conventions and best practices. This can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards writing clean and maintainable code. Consider having regular code reviews or meetings to discuss any issues or improvements to the coding standards.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Some general rules I follow: General  Indents are 4 spaces. Indent new levels Comments are < ~80 chars from the indent level. If I'm in two levels (8 spaces) that means the cursor stop will be around 88 characters.  Use multi-line comments. I prefer the look, however this is a subjective point. Comment now rather then later when you have no idea what's going on. Allman style braces. It's cleaner and is more readable. Subjective.  JavaScript  Use a library. jQuery in particular is very good. It eliminates all cross browser headaches. Understand that ID's are for particular elements, classes are for styles. ID's shouldn't be used more then once per page and they will have particular hooks attached to them. Use classes for things like navigation. Out source into methods. It's tempting to put all the code into the bind call, however putting it in it's own function will increase the flexibility of your code. Use functions instead of evals. That means setTimeout(function(){ /* Do something */ }, 1000); instead of setTimeout('doSomething', 1000); Use local variables with var.   HTML  Semantic markup. Use appropriate tags. Don't put <br />'s in there to add space, adjust margins and CSS rules. All tags are lowercase. All tags should end with a closing tag or be self closing. Make use of classes for layout that is similar. Have a couple of predefined classes like hide, clear, error, etc. Everything (scripts included) should go in <head>. Worry about optimizing (moving stuff around) when it presents a problem. External stylesheets and JavaScript source is a must unless it is page specific.  PHP  Frameworks are good, I recommend CodeIgniter. If you don't want to use a framework, try to use the latest version of PHP possible. (That means 5.3). Use includes to your advantage.  Clear injections or use prepared statements. Perform if checks on preconceived fail-secure values. $logged_in = false; if(check_user($user)) {      $logged_in = true;      $user = load_user($_SESSION); }  Know the difference between single and double quotes. Use single quotes when possible. Don't echo HTML.  ",

        "Question": "What I am looking for is the most optimal solution for storing content revisions in an MSSQL database. We have an application that allows users to make changes to small HTML content blocks similar to a wiki, but we need to have tight audit control over the changes. At any point in time, the manager might want to look at previously submitted contents or revert the entire HTML block back to the previous state. I had it setup in the past where we had a primary table that stored the HTML information (along with various other meta tags) and then an audit table that kept a copy of the entire data row everytime a change was made. What I am wondering is if this is the best way to go, or should I just keep 1 table with all the current records and the changes in it and just have a flag that lets me know which one is the current one? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are several approaches you could take to storing content revisions in an MSSQL database, each with its own trade-offs. Here are a few options to consider:  1. Separate Audit Table: This approach involves having a primary table that stores the current HTML content, and a separate audit table that stores copies of the content whenever a change is made. This approach allows for easy auditing and tracking of changes, as each revision is stored separately. However, it can lead to duplication of data and potentially increased storage requirements.  2. Single Table with Versioning: Alternatively, you could store all revisions in a single table, with a flag indicating which record is the current one. This approach can reduce data duplication and storage requirements, but can make it more difficult to track changes over time and potentially complicate querying for historical data.  3. Temporal Tables: If you are using SQL Server 2016 or newer, you could consider using temporal tables, which automatically track changes to data over time. This can simplify the process of storing and querying historical data, as the database management system handles much of the heavy lifting.   4. Change Data Capture (CDC) or Change Tracking: Another option to consider is using SQL Server's Change Data Capture or Change Tracking features, which can track changes to specific tables and provide an audit trail of all changes made. This can be a more lightweight option compared to storing full copies of each revision.  Ultimately, the best approach will depend on your specific requirements, such as how often changes are made, how important it is to track historical revisions, and any performance considerations. You may also want to consider implementing a combination of approaches, such as using a separate audit table for high-importance content and a single table with versioning for less critical data.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I have had decent success with doing a bit of both. One table that has the current version of the record and one table with every version (and a timestamp and an edited by) in another table. This gives you the advantage of having a complete copy of each version without the overhead of having to sort out the current version from all the others at runtime.  it also allows you to set much stricter permissions on the audit table and optionally implement the audit copy with triggers and completely hide the audit information from the rest of the app if you like that sort of thing.

        "Question": "It seems like most of the jobs I'm receiving, and most of the Internet, is still using standard HTML (HTML 4, let's say) + CSS + JS. Does anyone have any vision on where HTML5 is as a standard, particularly regarding acceptance and diffusion? It's easy to find information about inconsistencies between implementations of HTML5 and so forth. What I want to know about is relevance of HTML5. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "HTML5 has been a widely accepted standard for web development for many years now. It offers numerous new features and improvements over HTML4, such as support for multimedia elements, better semantics, and enhanced accessibility.  Despite some inconsistencies between browser implementations, HTML5 is still relevant and widely used in web development. Most modern websites are built using HTML5, and it has become the de facto standard for creating web pages.  In terms of acceptance and diffusion, HTML5 has been adopted by major tech companies and organizations, and is supported by all major web browsers. It is also backed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which ensures that the standard is continuously updated and maintained.  Overall, HTML5 is a crucial tool for web developers and is likely to remain relevant for the foreseeable future. It is important for developers to stay updated on the latest features and best practices in order to create modern and user-friendly websites.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I'd say definitely get in there and start learning some of the technologies involved.  Just be aware that 'HTML 5' right now is actually really a marketing term! HTML 5 has not been ratified as a standard yet and although all of the major players are throwing their support behind 'HTML 5' they're all actually just implementing bits a pieces of various specs including ECMA script (Java script), CSS, HTML and a whole lot more that I'm not qualified to talk about. MS for example released IE9 beta to great fanfare in San Fran, highlighting their awesome HTML 5 support.  Naturally their IE/GPU enhanced lovely demos didn't quite work so nice on other 'HTML 5' browsers such as the latest Chrome of FF Beta or Opera. So, um yeah, don't delay in starting to investigate - MS is banking on it heavily (even though they have their Silverlight platform) and I bet you'll see Adobe hedging their bets in the next few years as well. For production websites that users will use tomorrow?  Um don't use 'HTML 5' yet. ",
