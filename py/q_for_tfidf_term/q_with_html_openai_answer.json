        "Question": "At first glance, I'd say a good programming team needs to understand the following matters:  The details of the core language / framework HTML, (asynchronous) javascript SQL / data model Usability / UI design Security Project management.  If this team is not complete: what is needed? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "If the programming team is not complete, additional roles that may be needed include:  1. Graphic designer for creating visually appealing user interfaces 2. Quality assurance (QA) testing team to ensure the software functions correctly 3. User experience (UX) designer to optimize the user experience and improve usability 4. Project manager to oversee the project, coordinate tasks, and ensure deadlines are met 5. Database administrator for managing and optimizing the database 6. Network administrator for managing the network infrastructure 7. Technical writer for documenting the software and creating user manuals 8. DevOps engineer for automating software development processes and managing infrastructure deployment.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Customer (or an advocate of some sort).   Basically, someone that can say, \"Yes, you're building what I want and it's going to solve my problem.\" or that the team can go to when they have questions about how something is supposed to work.  That may or may not be the same person that is doing Project Management. Also, you're missing out on a QA person there.  You can't really depend on the developers to adequately test - they're usually too close to the code and the normal response for developers is to test happy path stuff, not doing weird crap like copy pasting War & Peace into a textbox and seeing what the application does.

        "Question": "i wonder apart from those very simple hello world apps, what other programs should i try developing for learning. i am entering uni next year and wonder what kind of programs will be developed in that environment.  this is not really a language specific thing, but if you want to know what i use currently mainly  windows: C#/WPF - i studied java/vb etc in poly but i think C# is the way to go, maybe even F# web: PHP/MySQL, Zend Framework/Doctrine, + HTML/CSS/JS(jQuery) of course. looking to try google app engine with python too.   for now, i am thinking of   todo lists apps that integrate with api eg. twitter/tumblr which i use text editor - i am currently trying to develop a text editor that uses markdown and generates html files for viewing (link to blog entry). not very pratical after i started developing it. cos when editing theres no formatting and in HTML format, i cannot edit directly  blog software (for web)  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Some other ideas for programs you could try developing for learning purposes include:  1. A chat application with real-time messaging using sockets or Firebase. 2. An image gallery website using a backend database to store and retrieve images. 3. A weather app that pulls data from a weather API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. 4. A simple game like tic-tac-toe or a memory card game to practice game development concepts. 5. An e-commerce website where users can browse products, add them to a cart, and make purchases. 6. A social media dashboard that aggregates feeds from multiple social media platforms in one place. 7. A personal finance tracker that allows users to input and analyze their expenses and income. 8. A recipe app that lets users search and save recipes, create shopping lists, and rate recipes they've tried.  Overall, the key is to choose projects that interest you and that will challenge you to learn new concepts and technologies. Good luck with your programming journey!",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Have a look at Project Euler.  There's nothing else like it for sharpening your foundational programming skills. ",
