        "Question": "I work for a company that supports several languages: COBOL, VB6, C#, and Java. I use those languages for my primary work, but I often find myself coding some minor programs (e.g. scripts) in Python because I find it to be the best tool for that type of task. For example: an analyst gives me a complex CSV file to populate some DB tables, so I use Python to parse it and create a DB script. What's the problem? The main problem I see is that a few parts of these quick and dirty scripts are slowly gaining importance and:  My company does not support Python They're not version controlled (I back them up in another way) My coworkers do not know Python  The analysts have even started to reference them in emails (\"launch the script that exports...\"), so they are needed more often than I initially thought. I should add that these scripts are just utilities that are not part of the main project; they simply help to get trivial tasks done in less time. For my own small tasks they help a lot. In short, if I were a lottery winner to be in a accident, my coworkers would need to keep the project alive without those scripts; they would spend more time fixing CSV errors by hand, for example. Is this a common scenario? Am I doing something wrong? What should I do? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It is not uncommon for developers to use languages or tools outside of their company's standard technology stack to quickly solve specific tasks or problems. However, the potential issues you mentioned - lack of support for Python, lack of version control, and lack of knowledge among coworkers - could indeed become problematic in the long run.  To address these concerns, you could consider the following steps:  1. Document your Python scripts: Write detailed documentation on how these scripts work, what they do, and how they can be maintained or modified. This will help your coworkers understand and potentially use the scripts if needed.   2. Automate the scripts: If possible, try to integrate these Python scripts into your company's main project or process. This will give them more visibility and potentially more support from your team.  3. Train your coworkers: Consider offering some training sessions or workshops to help your coworkers learn Python basics. This will not only help them understand your scripts but also broaden their skill set.  4. Discuss with your team: Have a conversation with your team or manager about the importance of these scripts and how they are helping to streamline tasks. This will help raise awareness and potentially lead to more support for using Python in your company.  Overall, it's great that you're using tools like Python to improve efficiency and solve problems quickly. Just be mindful of the potential challenges that may arise and take steps to address them proactively.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "You need to get the situation formalised as it shouldn't really have got to this point. However, these things happen so you need to explain to your boss that you created these scripts for personal use, but they've \"escaped\" into wider circulation. Admit (if necessary) that you were at fault for not bringing this to his attention sooner. At the very least the scripts should be put under source control \"just in case\" - then at least if you aren't available (for what ever reason) your co-workers will have access to the scripts. Then you either need to convince your boss that Python is the way to go for these or accept that you are going to have to re-write them in a supported language. If the cost of documenting the scripts and educating your co-workers in Python is lower than that of the re-write you might even win the argument. ",
