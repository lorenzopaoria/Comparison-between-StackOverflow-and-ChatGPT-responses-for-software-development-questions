        "Question": "When learning a new programming language you sometimes come across a language feature which  makes you wish you had it in your other programming languages that you know. What are some language feature which were at the time of learning very new to you and that you wish your other programming languages had.   An example of this is generators in Python or C#. Other examples may include list comprehensions in Python, template in C++ or LINQ in .NET or lazy evaluation in Haskell. What other semi-unique language features have you come across which were completely new and enlightening to you?  Are there other features of older programming languages which were unique and have fallen out of fashion? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One new language feature that I found very useful when learning Kotlin was extension functions. This allows you to add new functions to existing classes without modifying their source code. This can be extremely helpful when working with third-party libraries or classes that you do not have control over.  Another language feature that I found intriguing when learning Scala was pattern matching. This allows you to match on the structure of data types and extract values in a concise and readable way. This can make code more readable and maintainable, especially when working with complex data structures.  In terms of older programming languages, one unique feature that has fallen out of fashion is the use of pointers in languages like C and C++. While pointers are extremely powerful and efficient, they can also be error-prone and difficult to manage. As a result, many modern languages have moved away from using pointers in favor of safer memory management techniques like garbage collection.  Overall, learning new programming languages can introduce you to a wide range of unique and innovative language features that can improve your coding experience. It's always interesting to see how different languages approach common programming concepts and to explore new ways of solving problems.",

        "Question": "I work for a company that supports several languages: COBOL, VB6, C#, and Java. I use those languages for my primary work, but I often find myself coding some minor programs (e.g. scripts) in Python because I find it to be the best tool for that type of task. For example: an analyst gives me a complex CSV file to populate some DB tables, so I use Python to parse it and create a DB script. What's the problem? The main problem I see is that a few parts of these quick and dirty scripts are slowly gaining importance and:  My company does not support Python They're not version controlled (I back them up in another way) My coworkers do not know Python  The analysts have even started to reference them in emails (\"launch the script that exports...\"), so they are needed more often than I initially thought. I should add that these scripts are just utilities that are not part of the main project; they simply help to get trivial tasks done in less time. For my own small tasks they help a lot. In short, if I were a lottery winner to be in a accident, my coworkers would need to keep the project alive without those scripts; they would spend more time fixing CSV errors by hand, for example. Is this a common scenario? Am I doing something wrong? What should I do? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It's not uncommon for developers to use tools or languages outside of their company's standard stack for quick and dirty tasks. However, it is important to consider the potential risks and drawbacks that come with using such tools. In your case, the fact that your scripts are not supported by your company, not version controlled, and not known by your coworkers can pose a significant problem in the long run.  To address these issues, you could consider the following steps:  1. Communicate with your team and stakeholders: Make an effort to communicate with your team and stakeholders about the scripts you have developed in Python. Explain the value they bring to the team and project, and discuss ways to address the lack of support and version control for these scripts.  2. Document your scripts: Consider documenting your Python scripts, including how they work, what they do, and how to use them. This can help your coworkers understand and potentially maintain the scripts in your absence.  3. Train your coworkers: If possible, consider offering training or support to your coworkers to help them understand and use Python. This can help bridge the gap and ensure that your scripts are not a single point of failure for the project.  4. Explore alternatives: Consider exploring alternatives to using Python for these tasks, such as incorporating the functionality into your main project or using a language that is supported by your company.  Overall, it's important to strike a balance between efficiency and maintainability when choosing tools and languages for your tasks. By addressing the issues with your Python scripts proactively, you can help ensure that they continue to be a valuable asset to your team and project.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "You need to get the situation formalised as it shouldn't really have got to this point. However, these things happen so you need to explain to your boss that you created these scripts for personal use, but they've \"escaped\" into wider circulation. Admit (if necessary) that you were at fault for not bringing this to his attention sooner. At the very least the scripts should be put under source control \"just in case\" - then at least if you aren't available (for what ever reason) your co-workers will have access to the scripts. Then you either need to convince your boss that Python is the way to go for these or accept that you are going to have to re-write them in a supported language. If the cost of documenting the scripts and educating your co-workers in Python is lower than that of the re-write you might even win the argument. ",

I don't necessarily want to work on Google App Engine, I just find it convenient when it comes to hosting/environment/etc. and wondering if that's a good enough reason to learn python. In any case, I'm not looking for a debate between python and ruby but more on Google App Engine and whether its value is enough to dictate the language you should learn. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are a few factors to consider when choosing which language to learn based on the hosting platform. While Google App Engine might offer convenience in terms of hosting and environment setup, it is important to also consider the overall popularity and demand for the language in the industry.   Python is a widely used language with a large community of developers and a variety of applications in web development, data analysis, automation, machine learning, etc. Learning Python can open up a wide range of opportunities in the job market.   On the other hand, if you specifically want to work with Google App Engine and find its features and convenience appealing, then learning Python might be a good choice. However, it is also worth considering other factors such as the long-term viability of the platform and the specific job opportunities associated with it.   Ultimately, the decision to learn Python should not solely be based on the convenience of Google App Engine, but also on your personal interests, career goals, and the overall demand for Python in the industry.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "No. Google App Engine does provide a free/cheap infrastructure for hosting Python applications, but Ruby has virtually the same thing with Heroku (and Heroku has a lot less restrictions that GAE). Before using GAE, make sure to read very closely about the restrictions that Google puts on the platform, many of which can be significant barriers to the goal you're trying to achieve. Carlos Ble's blog post goes into much more depth about the many restrictions he's run into, but I'll give you a quick overview:  Python 2.7 only with no compiled extensions (major performance hit) 30 second request timeout (so much for easy large file uploads) and 10 second outside request timeout (so you can't query slow API's from your app) BigTable is stone age; no \"LIKE\" operators in your query and no single query can return more than 1,000 records Memcache has a 1 MB max value size Both BigTable and Memcache tend to die at a significant enough rate that it's productive to put code in your application to work around their failures  For a very small project, GAE is just fine; but if you're build something at a medium or large size, just be aware of the restrictions that may hamper you progress. For more information about what sort of quotas and limitations you may have to deal with, see the GAE docs:  http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas.html http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/billing.html  Also see this response on Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3068371/189079 ",

Eric S Raymond said it much better than I can in Why Python? As a related point, Python maintains its cleanness even while evolving rapidly. In most languages I've worked with, introduction of new language features introduces a lot of wrinkles.

Are huge (100+ line) functions still considered evil even if they're well-structured internally via the use of nested functions? Edit:  For those of you not familiar with Python or D, nested functions in these languages also allow access to the outer function scope.  In D this access allows mutation of variables in the outer scope.  In Python it only allows reading.  In D you can explicitly disable access to the outer scope in a nested function by declaring it static. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "The idea of \"evil\" functions, especially large ones, is not necessarily about the number of lines but more about the complexity and readability of the code.   Having a well-structured function with nested functions can help with the readability and organization of the code, but if the function is still too large and complex, it can become difficult to understand and maintain.   It's generally recommended to break down large functions into smaller, more manageable pieces, even if they are nested functions. This can improve code readability, testability, and maintainability in the long run.   However, if the nested functions are well-designed and clearly defined within the larger function, and if they help improve the overall structure and organization of the code, then having a large function with nested functions may be acceptable in some cases.   In the end, the goal is to write code that is clear, concise, and maintainable, so it's important to find the right balance between having well-structured nested functions and avoiding overly large and complex functions.",

I graduate from college this year, and over the course of the past few years, I have spent a lot of time learning new programming languages, web frameworks, Linux distributions, IDEs, etc., in an effort to find the best of each. I have installed and played around with Ubuntu, Gentoo, Debian, Arch Linux, SUSE, VectorLinux, Puppy Linux, Slackware, and Fedora, I have spend a good amount of time in Vim and Emacs, and have played around with Visual Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans, gedit, and several more obscure ones. I have played with all sorts of languages - I started with the common ones like C, Java, Visual Basic, but always heard that they were \"bad\" (for relative definitions of bad). I then discovered the scripting languages and have quite a bit of experience in PHP, Perl, Python, and Ruby. Then I heard that functional languages are where it's at, so I played around with Scheme, Lisp, Haskell, Erlang, and OCaml. I've played around with obscure languages like Forth and J. When I do web development, I go back and forth between frameworks and languages. Should I use plain PHP, Ruby on Rails, Django, CakePHP, CodeIgniter, Yii, Kohana, or make my own? I have a very broad and shallow knowledge of computer science. As soon as I have learned a useful amount of one technology, I see something else shiny and go after it. My progression often goes like this: \"Perl is better than PHP, but wait, Python is better than Perl. Oh, but now I see that Ruby has the power of Perl and it is cooler than Python. Well, now that I have seen a little of Ruby, it is too complicated. Python is cleaner. Oh, but it is too hard to deploy Python, so I should use PHP if I want to do real web development.\" And so on and so forth. What  technology should I use for projects?

Additionally, you could consider finding a mentor or joining a community of like-minded individuals who can provide guidance and support as you navigate your tech journey. They can help you stay focused, set goals, and hold you accountable for completing projects.

",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are a few reasons why a system might be written in C instead of Python.   Firstly, C is a low-level language that allows for more precise control over hardware and memory management, making it more suitable for applications that require high performance and efficiency.   Secondly, C has a long history of being used in embedded systems and operating systems, making it a more natural choice for certain types of projects.   Additionally, some companies may have existing codebases in C or may have a preference for C due to its familiarity and widespread use in certain industries.   While Python can be a powerful tool for many applications, it may not always be the best choice for projects that require high levels of performance or low-level control. Ultimately, the choice between C and Python will depend on the specific requirements of the project and the expertise of the team working on it.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "The main reason is because the software was already written in C (or C++ or whatever) before Python became a legitimate choice. If it's a question of rewriting your million lines of C code into Python or continuing with the C code, then the choice is clear. If you spend 12 month rewriting the code in Python, then that's 12 months where you're not adding new features and you'll basically spend 12 months getting back to exactly where you were. Not to mention that fact that you'll probably have missed all those corner-case bugs that had been fixed over the years in the C version, but not really called out in the code so when your Python dev comes along to port it and says \"why does the code do this? That seems wierd... I'll just do it this other way\" he's actually forgetting about that customer from 6 years ago who lost 12 months worth of payroll because of this obscure bug in their RAID controller that was worked around with just that specific piece of code. It's basically the same answer people get when they ask \"Why doesn't Microsoft rewrite Windows or Office or (insert-product-here) in .NET? I thought .NET was the poster-child for all Microsoft development these days?\" Now, when it comes to developing new products, then Python (and all the other possible choices) become a more viable option.

But, as a wise man once said (calling him a wise man only because I've no idea as to who actually said it; not sure whether he was that wise at all), to really know a language one does not only know its syntax, design, etc., advantages but also its drawbacks. No language is perfect, some are just better than others. So, what would be in your opinion, objective drawbacks of Python. Note: I'm not asking for a language comparison here (i.e. C# is better than Python because ... yadda yadda yadda) - more of an objective (to some level) opinion which language features are badly designed, whether, what are maybe some you're missing in it and so on. If must use another language as a comparison, but only to illustrate a point which would be hard to elaborate on otherwise (i.e. for ease of understanding) ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "One objective drawback of Python is its slower performance compared to lower-level languages like C or C++. This can be an issue for applications that require high computational speed or real-time processing.  Another drawback is Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which can limit the ability to take advantage of multi-core processors for parallel processing. This can be a significant limitation for applications that require intensive parallel computing.  Additionally, Python's dynamic typing can lead to more errors at runtime compared to statically typed languages. This can make it harder to catch bugs during development and can result in more maintenance work in the long run.  Overall, while Python is a versatile and user-friendly language, it does have its limitations in terms of performance, parallel processing capability, and type safety. It's important for developers to understand these drawbacks and consider them when choosing Python for a particular project.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I use Python somewhat regularly, and overall I consider it to be a very good language.  Nonetheless, no language is perfect.  Here are the drawbacks in order of importance to me personally:  It's slow.  I mean really, really slow.  A lot of times this doesn't matter, but it definitely means you'll need another language for those performance-critical bits. Nested functions kind of suck in that you can't modify variables in the outer scope.  Edit:  I still use Python 2 due to library support, and this design flaw irritates the heck out of me, but apparently it's fixed in Python 3 due to the nonlocal statement.  Can't wait for the libs I use to be ported so this flaw can be sent to the ash heap of history for good. It's missing a few features that can be useful to library/generic code and IMHO are simplicity taken to unhealthy extremes.  The most important ones I can think of are user-defined value types (I'm guessing these can be created with metaclass magic, but I've never tried), and ref function parameter. It's far from the metal.  Need to write threading primitives or kernel code or something?  Good luck. While I don't mind the lack of ability to catch semantic errors upfront as a tradeoff for the dynamism that Python offers, I wish there were a way to catch syntactic errors and silly things like mistyping variable names without having to actually run the code.

Yet I've not been aware of any way that Python code that I've written would work differently on another machine.  (Though I haven't written that much Python.) So what am I missing?  How is the JVM different from a Python interpreter?  Is there a way that Python lacks Java's platform independence?  Or is this just a cultural difference? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Java's \"Write Once, Run Anywhere\" concept is achieved through the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), which allows Java code to run on any system that has a JVM installed, regardless of the underlying operating system or hardware.  Python, on the other hand, is an interpreted language, which means that Python code is run directly by the Python interpreter on a specific platform. While Python code can run on multiple platforms as long as the Python interpreter is available for each platform, it is not as platform-independent as Java code running on the JVM.  In terms of platform independence, Java has a more strict and robust approach compared to Python. Java bytecode is compiled into a platform-independent format that can be executed by any JVM, while Python code is dependent on the Python interpreter available on the specific platform.  That being said, Python still has good cross-platform compatibility, and Python code can generally run on different systems without major issues. However, Java's platform independence is more ingrained into its design and architecture, making it a more attractive choice for developers who prioritize platform independence in their applications.   So, while both Java and Python are versatile and widely used languages, Java's platform independence through the JVM gives it a slight edge in terms of true cross-platform compatibility.",

        "Question": "Today I was looking at some blogs on Ruby and Python. A Python loyalist wrote a few lines of code with a loop to show how Python is faster than Ruby, with a similar code. I also found a blog of a Ruby disciple who says that it is wrong and he too submitted a code sample and benchmarking results. I am wondering whether background programs or background processes may sometime hinder the results and we may not get exact benchmarking scenario. Please correct me if I am wrong. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "You are correct to be cautious about potential factors affecting benchmarking results, such as background processes. It is important to ensure that the benchmarking environment is controlled and consistent to accurately compare the performance of different programming languages. Factors such as system resources, external dependencies, and other running processes can impact the speed of execution and skew the results.  To mitigate these potential issues, it is recommended to run benchmarks on a clean, dedicated system with minimal background processes running. This will help ensure that the results are as accurate and reliable as possible. Additionally, it is also a good practice to run multiple iterations of the benchmark and average the results to account for variability.  Overall, it is important to be mindful of potential confounding variables when performing benchmarking tests and to take steps to control for them to ensure accurate and meaningful results.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "It's possible.   But if that's the case, running the benchmark again would almost certainly produce different results.  That's why benchmarks are always run multiple times, to make sure that there are no background processes that are skewing the results. ",

        "Question": "I have a question that can be best answered here, given the vast experience some of you guys have! I am going to finish my bachelor's degree in CS and let's face it, I am just comfortable with C++ and Python. C++ - I have no experience to show for and I can't quote the C++ standard like some of the guys on SO do but yet I am comfortable with the language basics and the stuff that mostly matters. With Python, I have demonstrated work experience with a good company, so I can safely put that. I have never touched C, though I have been meaning to do it now. So I cannot write C on my resume because I have not done it ever. Sure I can finish K & R and get a sense of the language in a month, but I don't feel like writing it cause that would be being unfaithful to myself. So the big question is, are two languages on a a resume considered OK or that is usually a bad sign? Most resumes I have seen mention lots of languages and hence my question. Under the language section of my resume, I just mention: C++ and Python and that kinda looks empty! What are your views on this and what do you feel about such a situation? PS: I really don't want to write every single library or API I am familiar with. Or should I? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Having only two languages on your resume is perfectly fine, especially if those are the languages you are most comfortable with and have experience in. Quality is often more important than quantity when it comes to programming languages on a resume.   If you are worried about having a section that looks empty, you can consider adding a \"Skills\" section where you list the libraries, frameworks, and APIs you are familiar with. This can give potential employers a better idea of your specific experience and expertise.   Ultimately, it's important to be honest about your skills and experience on your resume. If you are confident in your abilities with C++ and Python, emphasize those languages and showcase your projects or work experience in those languages to demonstrate your proficiency. It's better to have a strong foundation in a couple of languages than to list many languages without being able to back them up.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "As long as you know how to think the problems through, it does not matter how many languages you are proficient in. But since you are proficient with C++, you could invest a few months time to gain some skill in C# or Java (or Ruby, for that matter). ",

        "Question": "In Python's tutorial one can read that Python's original implementation is in C;  On the other hand, the Python implementation, written in C, (...)  I'm very curious why was Python written in C and not C++?  I'd like to know the reasoning behind this decision and the answer should be supported by historical references (and not opinion based). ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Python was originally developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. When deciding on the implementation language for Python, Guido van Rossum chose C for several reasons:  1. Interoperability with C: One of the main goals of Python was to be able to easily interface with existing C libraries and systems. By implementing Python in C, developers could easily write extensions in C and integrate them with Python code. This allowed for greater flexibility and a wider range of capabilities for Python developers.  2. Portability: C is a highly portable language, meaning that code written in C can be easily compiled to run on different platforms and operating systems. By implementing Python in C, the language could be easily ported to various systems, making it more accessible to a wider audience.  3. Efficiency: C is a low-level language that allows for fine-grained control over memory management and execution speed. By implementing Python in C, developers could optimize performance and memory usage, making Python a more efficient and powerful language.  Additionally, at the time when Python was being developed, C++ was still a relatively new language and did not have the widespread adoption and support that C did. Choosing C over C++ ensured a more stable and mature foundation for Python's implementation.  In conclusion, Python was written in C primarily for its interoperability, portability, efficiency, and stability. These factors were instrumental in the decision-making process and have contributed to Python's success as a widely-used programming language.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "From everything I've seen, it's a combination of practical and historical reasons. The (mostly) historical reason is that CPython 1.0 was released in 1989. At that time, C was just recently standardized. C++ was almost unknown and decidedly non-portable, because almost nobody had a C++ compiler. Although C++ is much more widespread and easily available today, it would still take a fair amount of work to rewrite CPython into the subset of C that's compatible with C++. By itself, that work would provide little or no real benefit. It's a bit like Joel's blog post about starting over and doing a complete rewrite being the worst mistake a software company can make. I'd counter that by pointing to Microsoft's conversion from the Windows 3.0 core to the Windows NT core, and Apple's conversion from MacOS 9 to Mac OS/X. Neither one killed the company -- but both were definitely large, expensive, long-term projects. Both also point to something that's crucial to success: maintaining both code bases for long enough that (most) users can switch to the new code base at their leisure, based on (at least perceived) benefits. For a development team the size of Python's, however, that kind of change is much more difficult. Even the change from Python 2 to 3 has taken quite a bit of work, and required a similar overlap. At least in that case, however, there are direct benefits to the changes, which rewriting into C++ (by itself) wouldn't (at least immediately) provide. Linus Torvalds's rant against C++ was brought up, so I'll mention that as well. Nothing I've seen from Guido indicates that he has that sort of strong, negative feelings toward C++. About the worst I've seen him say is that teaching C++ is often a disaster -- but he immediately went on to say that this is largely because the teachers didn't/don't know C++.  I also think that while it's possible to convert a lot of C code to C++ with relative ease, that getting much real advantage from C++ requires not only quite a bit more rewriting than that, but also requires substantial re-education of most developers involved. Most well-written C++ is substantially different from well-written C to do the same things. It's not just a matter of changing malloc to new and printf to cout, by any stretch of the imagination. ",

        "Question": "I am going to interview within two weeks for an internship that would involve Python programming. Can anyone suggest what possible areas should I polish? I am looking for commonly asked stuff in interviews for Python openings. Apart from the fact that I have already been doing the language for over a year now, I fail to perceive what they can ask me.  Like for a C or C++ interview, there are lots of questions ranging from reversing of strings to building linked lists, but for a Python interview, I am clueless. Personal experiences and/ or suggestions are welcomed. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Here are some common topics and questions that are often asked in Python interviews:  1. Data Structures and Algorithms: Just like in C and C++ interviews, you may be asked to implement algorithms or data structures in Python. Make sure you are familiar with concepts such as lists, dictionaries, sets, stacks, queues, and trees.  2. Object-Oriented Programming: Be prepared to discuss the principles of object-oriented programming and how they apply to Python. You may be asked to explain concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.  3. Python Libraries: Familiarize yourself with popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. You may be asked how you would use these libraries to solve specific problems.  4. Exception Handling: Be prepared to discuss how you would handle exceptions in Python code. You may be asked to write code that demonstrates your understanding of exception handling.  5. Pythonic Code: Make sure you are familiar with Python idioms and best practices. You may be asked to write code that is considered \"Pythonic\" or to explain why certain coding styles are preferred in Python.  6. Coding Challenges: You may be asked to solve coding challenges or puzzles using Python. Practice solving problems on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank to prepare.  7. Debugging: Be prepared to discuss how you would debug Python code and identify common errors. You may be asked to troubleshoot code snippets that contain bugs.  Overall, it's important to demonstrate not only your technical knowledge of Python but also your problem-solving skills and ability to think critically. Good luck with your interview!",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "How about something involving Python list comprehensions?

        "Question": "I'm used to program with Python and GTK using pygtk library. I feel like my programs are not well separated according to MVC model. I think following a framework it would help me to design better desktop applications. I'd like to know which Python MVC framework for desktop apps you're using and why. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are several Python MVC frameworks that are commonly used for desktop applications. Some popular options include:  1. Kivy: Kivy is a Python framework for developing multitouch applications. It is open-source and cross-platform, making it a great choice for developing desktop applications that require touch input. Kivy follows the MVC design pattern and provides a clear separation between the view, model, and controller components of an application.  2. PyQT: PyQT is a set of Python bindings for the Qt application framework. Qt is a popular C++ framework for building cross-platform applications, and PyQT allows developers to use Qt in Python applications. PyQT follows the MVC design pattern and provides tools for creating desktop GUI applications with a clear separation between the model, view, and controller components.  3. PyGTK: PyGTK is a set of Python bindings for the GTK toolkit, which is a popular open-source toolkit for creating desktop applications. PyGTK follows the MVC design pattern and provides tools for creating GUI applications with a clear separation between the model, view, and controller components.  Each of these frameworks has its own strengths and weaknesses, so the best choice for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences. I recommend trying out a few different frameworks to see which one works best for you and your projects.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "first, I think Qt, and even it's Python bindings are way better structured than GTK; so you could first try it. second, it seems you're slightly confused by the MVC buzzword.  It was originally defined as a modular architecture for GUI applications; unfortunately, there's a completely different layered architecture for Web apps also called MVC. Maybe you feel your desktop apps are not very MVC because there not very web MVC, but they might be very GUI MVC nonetheless. ",

I know a bit of Perl and Python and I am looking to learn programming in more depth so that once I get the hang of it I can start developing applications and then websites.  I would like to know of an algorithm (sequence of steps :)) that could describe my approach towards learning programming in general. I have posted small questions on Perl/Python and I have recieved great help from everyone.  Note:- I am not in a hurry to learn. I know it takes time and that's fine. Please give any suggestions you think are valid. Also, please don't push me to learn Lisp, Haskell etc - I am a beginner. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Here is a suggested approach to learning programming in general:  1. Start by familiarizing yourself with the basic concepts of programming such as variables, data types, loops, conditions, functions, and arrays. You can find tutorials and courses online for this.  2. Choose a programming language to focus on. Since you already know some Perl and Python, you can continue learning one of these languages in more depth. Python is a popular choice for beginners due to its readability and versatility.  3. Practice writing code regularly. The more you code, the more comfortable you will become with the syntax and logic of the language.  4. Begin working on small projects to apply your knowledge. Start with simple programs and gradually increase the complexity as you gain more experience.  5. Seek help and support from online communities, forums, and tutorials. Don't hesitate to ask questions when you are stuck or confused about a concept.  6. Explore different programming paradigms such as object-oriented programming, functional programming, and procedural programming to broaden your understanding of programming principles.  7. As you become more proficient in your chosen language, consider learning additional languages to expand your skill set.  8. Stay updated with industry trends and best practices by reading books, blogs, attending workshops, and participating in coding challenges.  Remember that learning programming is a journey, so take your time and enjoy the process. Good luck!",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "The 11 step algorithm for learning a new programming language I'm currently in the process of learning Lisp, and I'd recommend the following algorithm:  Ask around if the language is worth learning and where good resources can be found. If positive responses to the language are given by experts then proceed to step 2. Create an initial programming environment. Keep it simple: text editor and compiler/interpreter. The bare minimum. Consider a specific user account on your machine with a special colour scheme to cue the change of mindset. Create the \"Hello, World!\" application.  Learn general syntax and control statements (if-then-else, repeat-until etc). Create sandbox to verify simple control cases (true/false evaluations etc). Try out every primitive type (int, double, string etc). Perform currency calculations. The number guessing game (as suggested by @Jeremy) is good for this. Create class (if applicable) with several methods/functions. Make calls between functions. Apply control statements. Learn arrays and collections. Create suitably complex examples that create arrays and collections of each of the classes/functions/primitives that are available to you Learn file IO. Create examples of reading, manipulating and writing binary and character based files. Ask more questions about idiomatic programming within the language (pointers, macros, monads, closures, support frameworks, build environments etc).  Choose (or adapt your existing) IDE to work in the recomended idiom. Write a variety of applications that please you (or your boss).  After 1 year return to step 1 for another language while maintaining your interest in the one you've just been learning.  ",

        "Question": "This is just a wondering I had while reading about interpreted and compiled languages.    Ruby is no doubt an interpreted language since the source code is processed by an interpreter at the point of execution. On the contrary C is a compiled language, as one have to compile the source code first according to the machine and then execute. This results is much faster execution. Now coming to Python:    A python code (somefile.py) when imported creates a file (somefile.pyc) in the same directory. Let us say the import is done in a python shell or django module. After the import I change the code a bit and execute the imported functions again to find that it is still running the old code. This suggests that *.pyc files are compiled python files similar to executable created after compilation of a C file, though I can't execute *.pyc file directly. When the python file (somefile.py) is executed directly ( ./somefile.py or python somefile.py ) no .pyc file is created and the code is executed as is indicating interpreted behavior.   These suggest that a python code is compiled every time it is imported in a new process to create a .pyc while it is interpreted when directly executed.  So which type of language should I consider it as? Interpreted or Compiled? And how does its efficiency compare to interpreted and compiled languages? According to wiki's Interpreted Languages page, it is listed as a language compiled to Virtual Machine Code, what is meant by that? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Python is typically considered an interpreted language because it is processed by an interpreter at runtime. However, the creation of .pyc files when a Python script is imported suggests that there is some compilation happening as well. This compilation process generates bytecode that can be executed by the Python interpreter, which can improve performance compared to interpreting the source code directly.  In terms of efficiency, Python's performance can vary depending on how it is used. Since it is an interpreted language, it may not be as fast as compiled languages like C. However, the use of .pyc files and bytecode can improve execution speed compared to interpreting the source code every time.  When Python code is compiled, it is converted into Virtual Machine Code (VMC) that can be executed by the Python virtual machine. This allows Python code to run on any platform that has a Python interpreter installed, without needing to be recompiled for each platform. This is similar to other languages that are compiled to run on virtual machines, such as Java.  Overall, Python can be considered a hybrid language that combines elements of both interpreted and compiled languages. Its efficiency can vary depending on how it is used and optimized, but its flexibility and ease of use make it a popular choice for many developers.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Python will fall under byte code interpreted. .py source code is first compiled to byte code as .pyc. This byte code can be interpreted (official CPython), or JIT compiled (PyPy). Python source code (.py) can be compiled to different byte code also like IronPython (.Net) or Jython (JVM). There are multiple implementations of Python language. The official one is a byte code interpreted one. There are byte code JIT compiled implementations too. For speed comparisons of various implementations of languages you can try here. ",
