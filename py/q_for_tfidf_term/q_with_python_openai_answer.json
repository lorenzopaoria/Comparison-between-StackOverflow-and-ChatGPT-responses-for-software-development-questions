        "Question": "I work for a company that supports several languages: COBOL, VB6, C#, and Java. I use those languages for my primary work, but I often find myself coding some minor programs (e.g. scripts) in Python because I find it to be the best tool for that type of task. For example: an analyst gives me a complex CSV file to populate some DB tables, so I use Python to parse it and create a DB script. What's the problem? The main problem I see is that a few parts of these quick and dirty scripts are slowly gaining importance and:  My company does not support Python They're not version controlled (I back them up in another way) My coworkers do not know Python  The analysts have even started to reference them in emails (\"launch the script that exports...\"), so they are needed more often than I initially thought. I should add that these scripts are just utilities that are not part of the main project; they simply help to get trivial tasks done in less time. For my own small tasks they help a lot. In short, if I were a lottery winner to be in a accident, my coworkers would need to keep the project alive without those scripts; they would spend more time fixing CSV errors by hand, for example. Is this a common scenario? Am I doing something wrong? What should I do? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "It is not uncommon for developers to use scripting languages like Python for quick and efficient tasks, especially when they find them to be the best tool for the job. However, it is important to consider the long-term implications of relying on scripts that are not supported by your company, not version controlled, and not known by your coworkers.  To address this issue, you could consider the following steps:  1. Talk to your colleagues and discuss the importance of these scripts in the day-to-day operations of the project. Explain why you chose Python and how it has helped to streamline tasks. This can help raise awareness and possibly generate interest in learning Python among your coworkers.  2. Work with your team to find a way to integrate these scripts into the main project in a more sustainable manner. This could involve refactoring the scripts, adding documentation, and setting up version control to ensure that they are maintained and updated properly.  3. Consider providing training or resources to help your colleagues learn Python, or provide support for them to be able to use the scripts in your absence. This will help to reduce the dependency on a single person for these tasks.  4. Communicate with your management about the importance of these scripts and the potential risks associated with not having them properly maintained. This can help to garner support for the integration and maintenance of these scripts within the company.  In conclusion, while using Python for quick and efficient tasks is common, it is important to ensure that these scripts are properly maintained and supported within the company to avoid potential issues in the future. By taking proactive steps to address these concerns, you can help to ensure the longevity and effectiveness of these scripts for your team.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "You need to get the situation formalised as it shouldn't really have got to this point. However, these things happen so you need to explain to your boss that you created these scripts for personal use, but they've \"escaped\" into wider circulation. Admit (if necessary) that you were at fault for not bringing this to his attention sooner. At the very least the scripts should be put under source control \"just in case\" - then at least if you aren't available (for what ever reason) your co-workers will have access to the scripts. Then you either need to convince your boss that Python is the way to go for these or accept that you are going to have to re-write them in a supported language. If the cost of documenting the scripts and educating your co-workers in Python is lower than that of the re-write you might even win the argument. ",
