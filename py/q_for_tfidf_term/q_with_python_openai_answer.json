        "Question": "When learning a new programming language you sometimes come across a language feature which  makes you wish you had it in your other programming languages that you know. What are some language feature which were at the time of learning very new to you and that you wish your other programming languages had.   An example of this is generators in Python or C#. Other examples may include list comprehensions in Python, template in C++ or LINQ in .NET or lazy evaluation in Haskell. What other semi-unique language features have you come across which were completely new and enlightening to you?  Are there other features of older programming languages which were unique and have fallen out of fashion? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Some other language features that I found very new and useful when learning new programming languages are:  - Pattern matching in functional programming languages like Haskell and Elixir - Async/await syntax for handling asynchronous operations in languages like JavaScript and C# - Type inference in languages like Rust and Swift - Optional and nullable types in languages like Kotlin and Swift - Pipelines in F# for functional composition of functions  As for older features that have fallen out of fashion, some examples may include:  - GOTO statements - Pointers and manual memory management - Global variables - Inline assembly language code  These features have largely been replaced with more modern, safer, and more maintainable alternatives in newer programming languages.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Practically anything in Haskell  Monads. Yes - the big scary word that makes increadibly easy parsers, IO, operations on Lists and other things so easy (once you notice common pattern) Arrows. The same for advanced users ;) Standard stuff like lambdas etc.  Currying functions Algebraic data types Pattern matching  And many more. PS. Yes. I am Haskell fanboy if anyone asked. ",

        "Question": "I work for a company that supports several languages: COBOL, VB6, C#, and Java. I use those languages for my primary work, but I often find myself coding some minor programs (e.g. scripts) in Python because I find it to be the best tool for that type of task. For example: an analyst gives me a complex CSV file to populate some DB tables, so I use Python to parse it and create a DB script. What's the problem? The main problem I see is that a few parts of these quick and dirty scripts are slowly gaining importance and:  My company does not support Python They're not version controlled (I back them up in another way) My coworkers do not know Python  The analysts have even started to reference them in emails (\"launch the script that exports...\"), so they are needed more often than I initially thought. I should add that these scripts are just utilities that are not part of the main project; they simply help to get trivial tasks done in less time. For my own small tasks they help a lot. In short, if I were a lottery winner to be in a accident, my coworkers would need to keep the project alive without those scripts; they would spend more time fixing CSV errors by hand, for example. Is this a common scenario? Am I doing something wrong? What should I do? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "This scenario is quite common in the software development world, where developers often use different tools and languages to get their job done efficiently. It is understandable that you have started using Python for these small utility scripts, as it is a powerful language for tasks like parsing files and automating repetitive tasks.  However, it is important to address the concerns you have mentioned. The fact that your company does not officially support Python and that your coworkers do not know the language can lead to potential problems in the future. It would be best to address this issue with your team and possibly with your management to see if there is a way to introduce Python as a supported language, or at least to provide some training for your coworkers.  In terms of version control, it is crucial to ensure that your scripts are properly version controlled to track changes and ensure that the latest version is always available. If your company has a version control system in place, try to incorporate your Python scripts into that system.  Overall, it is great that you have been proactive in finding ways to improve your workflow, but it is important to address these concerns to ensure that your scripts are not causing any unexpected issues in the future. Open communication with your team and possibly with management could help find a suitable solution for integrating Python into your workflow more seamlessly.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "You need to get the situation formalised as it shouldn't really have got to this point. However, these things happen so you need to explain to your boss that you created these scripts for personal use, but they've \"escaped\" into wider circulation. Admit (if necessary) that you were at fault for not bringing this to his attention sooner. At the very least the scripts should be put under source control \"just in case\" - then at least if you aren't available (for what ever reason) your co-workers will have access to the scripts. Then you either need to convince your boss that Python is the way to go for these or accept that you are going to have to re-write them in a supported language. If the cost of documenting the scripts and educating your co-workers in Python is lower than that of the re-write you might even win the argument. ",
