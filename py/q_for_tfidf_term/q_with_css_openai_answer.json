        "Question": "A few years ago I considered myself somewhat of a web developer, knowing the basic 3 languages (HTML, CSS, JS) and lots of PHP. Moving on from simple text to actual websites was a pain because of the so called \"standards\" out there, which at the time were ridiculously complicated for me. It pretty much boiled down to this (minus the IE related stuff):  Standards are there to replace old ways of doing things in a simpler way. However when trying to actually implement some of the stuff (Entirely CSS based layout for example), it took me 10x longer to actually do it then if I did the simpler and still working solution. If it rendered the same, then why should I use the more complicated example that takes 10x longer and breaks once you change browsers? This sparked many long religious debates in ##php, ##css, and ##js in Freenode IRC and actually got me banned from ##css because I messed with their little world over there. My question: Should I follow every single standard and coding conventions even if they take me 10x longer but get me the same result as the simple one?  For the poll tag, those of you who have websites of any size (huge or small), do you follow all the standards?  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "As a web developer, it is important to balance following standards and coding conventions with practicality and efficiency. While standards are there for a reason and can help ensure consistency and compatibility across browsers and devices, it is also important to consider the time and effort it takes to implement them.  Ultimately, the decision to follow every single standard and coding convention should be based on the specific project requirements, audience, and goals. In some cases, it may be necessary to prioritize functionality and speed over strict adherence to standards.  For the poll tag, it would be interesting to see how many web developers prioritize following all standards and coding conventions versus prioritizing practicality and efficiency in their web development projects.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "The standards writers have thought of things that haven't occurred to you, such as accessibility concerns. Standards exist for a reason. And, with HTML5, standards are fairly easy to follow. There may, occasionally, be reason to not follow the standard, but following it should be your default behaviour. ",

        "Question": "I am thinking about creating a silverlight application, and I lack the skills to create a good looking UI. Today's graphic designers usually know HTML and CSS and thus save me the trouble of doing something I am not very good with. Is this the same case with XAML? Do I have to hire two employees for this job? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Not necessarily. XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language) is a markup language used for creating user interfaces in Silverlight applications. While graphic designers may not be as familiar with XAML as they are with HTML and CSS, some may still have experience designing interfaces using XAML.  If you are unable to find a graphic designer who is familiar with XAML, you may consider hiring a designer who is willing to learn and adapt to using XAML for your project. Alternatively, you could also consider hiring a developer who is proficient in XAML to work alongside a graphic designer to create a visually appealing UI for your application.  Ultimately, whether you need to hire one or two employees for this job will depend on the specific skills and experience of the individuals you are able to find for your project.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Silverlight is a pretty cool technology, but I'm seriously concerned about its future. However, if you want a cool UI done in XAML... you have several options.   Hire a Silverlight/WPF dev and hope they also design / See #3 Hire a UX designer with XAML skillz Hire a great graphic designer and then hire #1 OR you can use the built-in Ai/PSD to XAML tools in Expression Studio (design).  Tons of options, if you are a small company you may even qualify for Bizspark ( a free version of Expression Studio).  Good luck. ",
