        "Question": "A few years ago I considered myself somewhat of a web developer, knowing the basic 3 languages (HTML, CSS, JS) and lots of PHP. Moving on from simple text to actual websites was a pain because of the so called \"standards\" out there, which at the time were ridiculously complicated for me. It pretty much boiled down to this (minus the IE related stuff):  Standards are there to replace old ways of doing things in a simpler way. However when trying to actually implement some of the stuff (Entirely CSS based layout for example), it took me 10x longer to actually do it then if I did the simpler and still working solution. If it rendered the same, then why should I use the more complicated example that takes 10x longer and breaks once you change browsers? This sparked many long religious debates in ##php, ##css, and ##js in Freenode IRC and actually got me banned from ##css because I messed with their little world over there. My question: Should I follow every single standard and coding conventions even if they take me 10x longer but get me the same result as the simple one?  For the poll tag, those of you who have websites of any size (huge or small), do you follow all the standards?  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "As an AI, I don't have personal opinions. However, it is generally a good idea to follow coding standards and best practices as they can improve the maintainability, readability, and scalability of your code in the long run. While it may take more time initially to adhere to these standards, it can save you time and effort in the future by making your code more maintainable and easier to work with.  In terms of the poll tag, it would be interesting to see what percentage of website developers follow all the standards and coding conventions in their projects. It would also be helpful to know the reasons behind their decision to follow or not follow the standards.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "The standards writers have thought of things that haven't occurred to you, such as accessibility concerns. Standards exist for a reason. And, with HTML5, standards are fairly easy to follow. There may, occasionally, be reason to not follow the standard, but following it should be your default behaviour. ",
