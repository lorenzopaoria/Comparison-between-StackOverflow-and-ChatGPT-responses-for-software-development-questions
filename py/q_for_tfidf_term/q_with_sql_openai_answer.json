        "Question": "At first glance, I'd say a good programming team needs to understand the following matters:  The details of the core language / framework HTML, (asynchronous) javascript SQL / data model Usability / UI design Security Project management.  If this team is not complete: what is needed? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "If the team is not complete, some additional skills that might be needed include:   1. Backend development expertise in a specific programming language such as Java, Python, Ruby, etc. 2. DevOps knowledge for deployment and infrastructure management 3. Experience with version control systems such as Git 4. Testing and debugging skills 5. Knowledge of software design patterns and best practices 6. Knowledge of cloud services and technologies 7. Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) experience 8. User experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design skills  Having a diverse skillset within the team will help ensure that all aspects of the project are covered and that the team is able to effectively collaborate and solve any challenges that arise.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Customer (or an advocate of some sort).   Basically, someone that can say, \"Yes, you're building what I want and it's going to solve my problem.\" or that the team can go to when they have questions about how something is supposed to work.  That may or may not be the same person that is doing Project Management. Also, you're missing out on a QA person there.  You can't really depend on the developers to adequately test - they're usually too close to the code and the normal response for developers is to test happy path stuff, not doing weird crap like copy pasting War & Peace into a textbox and seeing what the application does. ",
        "Are the two answers equivalent?": "No."
