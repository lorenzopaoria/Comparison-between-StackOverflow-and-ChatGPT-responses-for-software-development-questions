        "Question": "This question is a little abstract but I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction. My question is what amount of time can one expect to devote to a software project's bugs in relation to the original development time. I realize there are a huge number of determining factors that go into but I was hoping for a typical or average breakdown.  For example, if Project A takes 40 hours to complete and an additional 10 fixing bugs then this project would have a 4:1 ratio. If another Project (B) takes 10 hours to complete but another 8 on bugs then it would have a 5:4 ratio.  Is this a documented/researched concept? UPDATE Thanks for all the informative answers. I understand that it's impossible to put a standard to this kind of metric due to all the variables and environmental factors involved. Before I assign an answer I'd like to know if this metric has an agreed-upon name so I can do further research. I would like to get to a point where I can understand the measurements necessary to generate the metrics myself and eventually come up with a baseline standard for my project. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "The concept you are referring to is often referred to as the \"bug to development ratio\" in software development. While there is no standard or agreed-upon ratio, it is commonly understood that bug fixing can take anywhere from 20-50% of the total project time. However, this can vary greatly depending on the complexity of the project, the experience of the developers, the quality of the initial code, and many other factors.  It is important to keep in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all ratio for bug fixing in software projects, as each project is unique. It is recommended to track bug fixing time and compare it to development time on individual projects to get a better understanding of the specific bug to development ratio for your team and projects. This will allow you to make more accurate estimates in the future and improve the quality of your software development process.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "The equilibrium percentage of total capacity allocated to defect-fixing is equal to the defect injection rate. Many factors can affect this rate, among them, of course: what kind of product the team is developing, what technologies and technical practices they use, the team's skill level, the company culture, etc. Considering Team B, if they create on average 8 units of rework for every 10 units of work they complete, then working those 8 units will create new 6.4 units of rework.  We can estimate the total effort they will eventually have to expend as the sum of a geometric progression: 10 + 8 + 6.4 + 5.12 + ... The number of bugs will decrease exponentially with time, but Team B has such a coefficient in their exponent that it will go to zero very slowly.  Actually, the sum of the first three terms in the above series is only 24.4; of the first five, 33.6; of the first 10, 45; of the entire series, 50.  So, Team B summary: defect injection rate, 0.8; feature development, 10/50 = 20%; defect-fixing, 80%.  20/80 is their sustainable capacity allocation. By contrast, Team A is in much better shape.  Their progression looks like this: 40 + 10 + 2.5 + 0.625 + ... The sum of this series is 53 1/3, so Team A's feature development allocation is 40/(53 1/3) = 75% and defect-fixing allocation is 25%, which matches their defect injection rate of 10/40 = 0.25. Actually, all terms in Team A's series after the first three are negligibly small.  What this means in practical terms is that Team A can probably squash all their bugs with a couple of maintenance releases, the second release being pretty small in scope.  This also creates an illusion that any team can do that.  But not Team B. I thought about this equivalence while reading David Anderson's new book, \"Kanban\".  (The book is on a different subject, but addresses quality concerns, too.)  When discussing software quality, Anderson quotes this book, by Capers Jones, \"Software Assessments, Benchmarks, and Best Practices\": \"...in 2000... measured software quality for North American teams... ranged from 6 defects per function point down to less than 3 per 100 function points, a range of 200 to 1.  The midpoint is approximately 1 defect per 0.6 to 1.0 function points.  This implies that it is common for teams to spend more than 90 percent of their effort fixing defects.\"  He cites an example provided by one of his colleagues of a company that spends 90% of the time fixing their bugs. The fluency with which Anderson goes from the defect injection rate to the defext-fixing capacity allocation (failure demand is the term for it) suggests that the equivalence of the two things is well known to software quality researchers and has probably been known for some time. The key words in the line of reasoning that I'm trying to present here are \"equlibrium\" and \"sustainable\".  If we take away sustainability, then there's an obvious way to cheat these numbers: you do the initial coding, then move on to code somewhere else, and leave maintenance to others.  Or you run up the technical debt and unload it on a new owner. Obviously, no particular allocation will suit all teams.  If we decreed that 20% must be spent on bugs, then, if a team has an ultra-low defect injection rate, they will simply not have enough bugs to fill the time, and if a team had a very high rate, their bugs will continue to accumulate. The math I used here is way simplified.  I neglected things like transaction costs (planning and estimation meetings, post-mortems, etc.), which would affect the percentages somewhat.  I also omitted equations simulating sustaining one product and developing another one concurrently.  But the conclusion still stands.  Do what you can, in terms of technical practices, like unit-testing, continuous integration, code reviews, etc., to reduce your defect injection rate and, consequently, your failure demand.  If you can create only one bug for every 10 features, you will have a lot of free time to develop new features and satisfy your customers. ",

        "ChatGpt answer": "1. Talk to your co-worker: Before taking any action, it's important to have a conversation with your co-worker about why they are making these changes to your code. It's possible they have a valid reason that you may not be aware of.  2. Explain the impact: Make sure your co-worker understands that changing the appearance of the code can have unintended consequences and may make it harder for others to understand and work with the code in the future.  3. Set boundaries: If the changes being made are purely cosmetic and not adding any value, set clear boundaries with your co-worker about what is acceptable and what is not when editing your code.  4. Involve a team lead or manager: If you are unable to come to a resolution with your co-worker, involve a team lead or manager to mediate the situation and help establish guidelines for code editing within the team.  5. Document the changes: If your co-worker insists on making changes to your code, make sure to document these changes and the reasons behind them for future reference.

        "Question": "I mean, I still have a MSX2 with a Z80 processor and if you look at any Konami's game made for that computer in its time (roughly between '84 and '90) is amazing the high quality code of those games. I was a kid at the time, trying to learn how to program a computer and still today fascinated me how well made they are, mostly zero bugs or glitches, despite the really complex behavior. What hardware/software tools could they have used to accomplish that quality, which metodology? I know computers are really more complex today but at that time, even a stock control program I made in Basic was plagued with many bugs and was painful to debug. Any light you can shed will be deeply appreciated.  ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "Konami was known for their high quality games on the MSX2 platform, and their success can be attributed to several factors.  First, Konami likely used a team of skilled programmers and developers who were experienced in working with the specific hardware and software limitations of the MSX2. This knowledge would have allowed them to optimize their code and make efficient use of the limited resources available on the system.  Additionally, Konami may have used specialized tools and software development kits (SDKs) provided by the hardware manufacturer or developed in-house to streamline the game development process. These tools would have allowed the developers to quickly test and debug their code, identify and fix any potential issues, and ultimately produce a polished and bug-free game.  In terms of methodology, Konami likely followed a structured and systematic approach to game development, with clear milestones, objectives, and quality assurance processes in place. This would have helped them to identify and address any potential issues early on in the development cycle, ensuring that the final product met their high standards of quality.  Overall, Konami's success on the MSX2 platform can be attributed to a combination of skilled developers, specialized tools and technology, and a disciplined approach to game development. By leveraging these resources effectively, they were able to create some of the most memorable and technically impressive games of their time.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "I don't know anything about Konami, so I'm taking an educated guess here.  Games on machines like the MSX would have required direct access to the hardware, so that pretty much limits the choice of languages to either C or Z80 assembly language.  (There were C compilers for the Z80 back then, for example this one.) I doubt if the games were completely written in C, if at all; mostly likely a lot of assembly code for performance reasons. As far as platforms go, since the MSX didn't have a hard drive, I would further assume the programs were initially written on a larger Z80 system, perhaps running CP/M.  For debugging, the code could probably have been downloaded into a special game cartridge for the MSX that had RAM memory in place of ROM -- this would have allowed the developer to download the program over and over again without burning ROM chips.  Debugging (e.g. setting breakpoints) could have been accomplished by replacing the Z80 inside the MSX with an In-Circuit Emulator (ICE) interface. ",

        "Question": "No one's perfect, and no matter what we do, we are going to produce code that has bugs in it from time to time. What are some methods/techniques for reducing the number of bugs you produce, both when writing new software and changing/maintaining existing code? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "1. Code reviews: have someone else review your code to catch any potential bugs before they make it into production.  2. Unit testing: write thorough unit tests for your code to ensure that it behaves as expected in various scenarios.  3. Automated testing: set up automated testing suites to regularly test your code and catch bugs early on.  4. Use version control: keep track of changes to your code using version control systems like Git, so you can easily revert back to previous versions if needed.  5. Follow coding standards: adhere to coding standards and best practices to make your code more readable and maintainable, reducing the chances of introducing bugs.  6. Refactor regularly: periodically refactor your code to make it more modular, efficient, and easier to understand, which can help prevent bugs from occurring.  7. Document your code: provide detailed documentation and comments in your code to better explain its purpose and functioning, making it easier for others (and yourself) to understand and debug it.  8. Use static code analysis tools: leverage tools that analyze your code for potential issues, such as code smells or potential bugs, helping you catch them before they cause problems.  9. Learn from past mistakes: review past bugs and errors in your code to learn from them and avoid making the same mistakes in the future.  10. Continuously improve: stay updated on new technologies, practices, and techniques in software development to constantly improve your skills and reduce the likelihood of introducing bugs.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "Avoid fancy coding.  The more complicated the code, the more likely there's bugs.  Usually on modern systems, clearly written code will be fast and small enough. Use available libraries.  The easiest way to not have bugs writing a utility routine is to not write it. Learn a few formal techniques for the more complicated stuff.  If there's complicated conditions, nail them down with pen and paper.  Ideally, know some proof techniques.  If I can prove code correct, it's almost always good except for big, dumb, obvious bugs that are easy to fix.  Obviously, this only goes so far, but sometimes you can formally reason about small but complicated things. For existing code, learn how to refactor:  how to make small changes in the code, often using an automated tool, that make the code more readable without changing the behavior. Don't do anything too quickly.  Taking a little time up front to do things right, to check what you've done, and to think about what you're doing can pay off big time later. Once you've written the code, use what you've got to make it good.  Unit tests are great.  You can often write tests ahead of time, which can be great feedback (if done consistently, this is test-driven development). Compile with warning options, and pay attention to the warnings.   Get somebody else to look at the code.  Formal code reviews are good, but they may not be at a convenient time. Pull requests, or similar if your scm doesn't support them allow for asynchronous reviews. Buddy checking can be a less formal review. Pair programming ensures two pairs of eyes look at everything.

        "Question": "Bugs creeping into code can be minimized, but not entirely eliminated as it is written - programmers are, although many would disagree, only humans. When we do detect an error in our code, what can we do to weed it out? How should we approach it to make most effective use of our valuable time and enable us to spend less time trying to find it and more time coding? Also, what should we avoid when debugging? Note here that we're not talking about preventing bugs; we're talking about what to do when bugs do appear. This is a wide field, I know, and may be highly dependent on language, platform and tools. If so, keep to encompassing answers such as mindsets and general methods. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "When it comes to debugging code, there are several approaches and best practices that can help make the process more efficient and effective:  1. **Break the problem down**: When encountering a bug, it can be helpful to break down the code into smaller sections and test each section individually. This can help pinpoint where the issue is occurring and make it easier to identify the specific cause of the bug.  2. **Use debugging tools**: Most coding environments and IDEs come with debugging tools that can help track down bugs more easily. These tools allow you to step through the code line by line, set breakpoints, and inspect variables to see their values at runtime.  3. **Check logs and error messages**: Error messages and logs can provide valuable information about the bug and its cause. Make sure to carefully read and analyze any error messages that are generated to help identify the issue.  4. **Use print statements**: Inserting print statements or log messages at key points in the code can help track the flow of the program and identify where the bug may be occurring. Print statements can help you see the values of variables at different points in the code and can be a useful tool for debugging.  5. **Take breaks**: Debugging can be frustrating and time-consuming, so it's important to take breaks and step away from the code periodically. This can help clear your mind and give you a fresh perspective when you come back to the problem.  6. **Avoid making assumptions**: When debugging, it's important to avoid making assumptions about what the problem might be. Take the time to carefully analyze the code and gather as much information as possible before jumping to conclusions.  7. **Avoid changing multiple things at once**: When attempting to fix a bug, it can be tempting to make multiple changes to the code at once. However, this can make it difficult to track down the root cause of the issue. Instead, make small, incremental changes and test each one individually to see if it resolves the bug.  In conclusion, debugging code is a crucial part of the software development process, and having a systematic approach can help make the process more efficient and effective. By taking a methodical approach, using the right tools, and staying patient and persistent, you can successfully weed out bugs and spend more time coding and less time debugging.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "The mindset and attitude to debugging is perhaps the most important part, because it determines how effectively you'll fix the error, and what you'll learn from it \u2014 if anything.   Classics on software development like The Pragmatic Programmer and Code Complete basically argue for the same approach: every error is an opportunity to learn, almost always about yourself (because only beginners blame the compiler/computer first).   So treat it as a mystery which will be interesting to crack.  And cracking that mystery should be done systematically, by expressing our assumptions (to ourselves, or to others) and then testing our assumptions, one-by-one if need be \u2014 using every tool at our disposal, especially debuggers and automated test frameworks.  Then after the mystery is solved, you can do even better by looking through all your code for similar errors you may have made; and write an automated test to ensure the error will not happen unknowingly again. One last note - I prefer to call errors \"errors\" and not \"bugs\" - Dijkstra chided his colleagues for using the latter term because it's dishonest, supporting the idea that pernicious and fickle bug-fairies planted bugs in our programs while we weren't looking, instead of being there because of our own (sloppy) thinking: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html  We could, for instance, begin with cleaning up our language by no longer calling a bug a bug but by calling it an error. It is much more honest because it squarely puts the blame where it belongs, viz. with the programmer who made the error. The animistic metaphor of the bug that maliciously sneaked in while the programmer was not looking is intellectually dishonest as it disguises that the error is the programmer's own creation. The nice thing of this simple change of vocabulary is that it has such a profound effect: while, before, a program with only one bug used to be \"almost correct\", afterwards a program with an error is just \"wrong\" (because in error).

        "Question": "The question of managing bugs in production has been a large feature in my mind of late. Sprint's are not meant to have any items added into them, but for critical bugs, this is simply unavoidable. How does one go about managing this break in the sprint? Do you simply give a sprint a percentage \"allowance\" of time, thus only filling say 80% of the schedule with sprint items \"just in case\"? ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "There are a few strategies that can be used to manage bugs in production during a sprint. One common approach is to allocate a certain percentage of the sprint capacity to handle unexpected issues, such as bugs in production. This allows for some flexibility and ensures that the team has the capacity to address critical issues without derailing the entire sprint.  Another approach is to prioritize bug fixes alongside other sprint backlog items and adjust the sprint plan as needed. This may involve reprioritizing or deprioritizing certain tasks in order to accommodate the bug fixes. This approach requires good communication and collaboration within the team to ensure that all members are aware of any changes to the sprint plan.  Ultimately, the key to managing bugs in production during a sprint is to be prepared for unexpected issues and to have a plan in place for how to address them. This may involve setting aside some capacity in the sprint for bug fixes, reprioritizing tasks as needed, or implementing other strategies to ensure that critical issues can be addressed in a timely manner.",
        "Stack Overflow best answer": "If this is critical, you must handle it. To measure its impact on the sprint, you must log it.  Look at this information radiator:  There is a part called \"Unplanned items\". Put your critical bug there. As you see there is the inverse with \"Next\" part where you put more user stories than planned in case you complete the sprint faster.

        "Question": "What language, in your opinion, allows the average programmer to output features with the least amount of hard-to-find bugs? This is of course, a very broad question, and I'm interested in very broad and general answers and wisdoms. Personally I find that I spend very little time looking for strange bugs in Java and C# programs, while C++ code has its distinct set of recurring bugs, and Python/similar has its own set of common and silly bugs that would be detected by the compiler in other languages. Also I find it hard to consider functional languages in this regard, because I've never seen a big and complex program written in entirely functional code. Your input please. Edit: Completely arbitrary clarification of hard-to-find bug: Takes more than 15 minutes to reproduce, or more than 1 hour to find cause of and fix. Forgive me if this is a duplicate, but I didn't find anything on this specific topic. ",
        "ChatGpt answer": "In my opinion, languages like Java and C# tend to have fewer hard-to-find bugs due to their strict type systems and more explicit error handling mechanisms. These languages also have robust tools and IDEs that can help catch potential bugs before they even occur. On the other hand, languages like C++ can be more prone to memory-related bugs and other low-level issues that can be harder to debug.  Functional languages like Haskell and Scala also have strong static type systems and immutability by default, which can help eliminate certain types of bugs. However, as you mentioned, large and complex programs written entirely in a functional style may not be as common, making it difficult to assess their effectiveness in preventing hard-to-find bugs.  Ultimately, the language that allows the average programmer to output features with the least amount of hard-to-find bugs will vary based on the programmer's experience, familiarity with the language, and the specific requirements of the project. It's important to choose a language that fits the project's needs and the team's expertise to minimize the likelihood of encountering hard-to-find bugs.",
