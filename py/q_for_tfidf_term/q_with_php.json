        "Question": "I am excited about the changes in PHP 6 previewed in PHP 5.3+. However, I wonder why it takes so long to release PHP 6? Books about it have been published since 2008, and announcements on it since 2007, but I am yet to hear about an alpha or a beta. Why does it take so long to release it? Or is that the way it goes with all languages when they transition to a major release where I guess it takes around 4-5 years to release? ",

        "Best answer": "The release timetable is not unusual for languages, and it's not even that unusual for PHP: 5.0 was released in 2004, but 4.0 was released in 2000.  Compare this to the last stable releases for C (2000), Fortran (2003), or C++ (2003). One other thing to keep in mind is that 5.3 was a major release in all but name. It adds a lot of stuff that was originally destined for PHP 6. Due to development problems with unicode support (a major part of PHP 6), it was decided to release what was stable at the time as a 5.x branch. ",

        "Question": "There's around a zillion \"PHP frameworks\". And most of them bill themselves as following the MVC pattern. While it's welcome to overcome osCommerce coding style (processing logic heavily intermixed with SQL and HTML), there are certainly simpler and easier to follow approaches to get a maintainable application design. The original MVC concept was targetted at GUI applications. And for Gtk/Python it seems feasible to follow it accordingly. But PHP web apps don't operate on live Views (GUI elements) and a persistent Controller runtime. It's quite certainly a misnomer if it just describes the used code + directory grouping or class naming. \"MVC\" seems to be used like a buzzword for PHP frameworks. And I've actually seen one or two mature PHP frameworks admit it, but redefining the phrase anyway to match interna. So is it generally snake oil? Why isn't better terminology used, and a more sensible concept for maintainable PHP propagated? Some elaborative reasoning Why I suspect that PHP implementations don't follow the real MVC pattern: Models: in theory, Models should be fat and contain business logic, and controllers should be thin handlers (input->output). In reality the PHP frameworks advocate shallow Models. CI and Symfony for example equate Model == ORM. Even HTTP input is handled by the controller, isn't treated as model. Views: workarounds with AJAX discounted, there can't be Views on web pages. PHP frameworks still pump out pages. The interface still effectively follows the ordinary HTTP model, there's no advantage over non-MVC applications. (And lastly, none of the widespread php frameworks can factually output to GUI Views instead of HTML. I've seen a PHP library that can operate Gtk/Console/Web, but the frameworks don't.) Controller: I'm unsure. Controllers probably don't need to be long-running and persistently active in the MVC model. In PHP framework context, they're however mostly request handlers. Not really something to get argumentative about, but it just feels slightly buzzwordish. Would there be better descriptors? I've seen acronyms like PMVC or HMVC thrown around. Though descriptions get more ambigous there, maybe these would describe the current web frameworks less hokey? ",

        "Best answer": "I think you are looking at this in completely the wrong way. A GUI app and a web page are worlds apart so the exact same definition of MVC will never work for both. MVC is more about the ideal: separating certain parts of the app like display and logic. In PHP (or the web in general), a View is the web page itself: the HTML output. It's not \"live\" as per your definition, but you simply click links to go back to the controller (i.e. another page request). The Controller and Model is where things do differ, like you explained. In PHP the model tends to be the data layer, interacting with the database and so on. But it is still modelling the situation, and the controller still controls the application flow, if only once per page load. So the name \"Model-View-Controller\" is perfectly logical, albeit a different implementation in GUI apps vs web apps. ",

        "Question": "I've recently been frequented by erroneous error messages from mod_security. Its filter sets cover outdated PHP exploits, and I have to rewrite my stuff because Wordpress&Co had bugs years ago.   Does this happen to anyone else?  Apache mod_security blocks possibly   dangerous HTTP requests before they   reach applications (PHP specifically).   It uses various filter sets, mostly   regex based.  So I have a nice shared hosting provider, technically apt and stuff. But this bugged me: Just last week I had to change a parameter name &src= in one of my apps because mod_security blocks ANY requests with that. I didn't look up its details, but this filter rule was preventing the exploitability of another app which I don't use and probably never had heard about. Still I had to rewrite my code (renaming parameter often suffices to trick mod_security) which had nothing to do or in common with that! And today, a silly regex blocks form submissions, because I wanted to submit php sample code. Given, this is the simple stuff that mod_security is there to protect against. But I don't believe mod_security can detect seriously obfuscated code, and just goes off at obvious (and in this case totally trivial) php snippets. Basically I'm getting penalized by mod_security because other people released bug-prone apps. (Not saying my apps are ultra secure - I'm pretty security wary, but make no hyperbolic claims.) I've already asked my provider to disable it anyway, the benefits are too minuscle IMO and for my apps.  What do you think? Does mod_security make much sense outside of WP hosting? Or is it really just a bunch of blacklists of long passed security bugs? Which of its rules are actually helpful? Is there an application level equivalent? ",

        "Best answer": "I personally see mod_security as a patch. I use it on some of our servers where we can't control the code that's uploaded (shared hosting servers, for example), but it's never really felt like a good solution to me. Based on it's wide and very general blacklist approach, it's more of a patch to cover up security holes than a good security policy. It can also provide a false sense of security. mod_security can reveal some common attacks but can by no means prevent any attack. Again, it's a blacklist of common known attacks. If you simply install mod_security and think that you're magically secure, you're horribly mistaken. I have found a much better policy to me managed servers where my team reviews all code that is placed on them, combined with lots of logs, logfile analysis, reporting systems, and intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IPS). Everytime third-party or open-source software is installed (I'm looking at you, WordPress!) we keep a log of where it was installed, and when new versions are released we update every copy that was installed. Again, you're more likely to find mod_security on a shared hosting server, as you're experiencing now. As you grow you can move to a VPS or clod based hosting provider where you get your own managed environment and can more tightly control the available software. ",

But I just can't seem to really really grasp SQL. I mean, I can select, update, insert, delete, join, etc. but when it comes to more complex stuff I am lost. How to write a more complicated select statement, how to use indexes properly, which engine to use, etc. For some reason I really find the mysql docs hard to follow, but the php ones easy to follow. I am starting to think that maybe my brain is just wired in a way that makes programming make since but sql confusing. I don't know. Most people think Regex is so confusing but to me it makes more scientific sense than how to construct an sql statement. Please don't get me wrong, I am not hating on SQL, I really like it, I just want to understand it better. Whats the best/fastest way to really master MySQL?  When I say \"master\" I don't mean the guru among gurus, I mean smart enough to figure out most of the questions I ask on SO myself without needing help.  ",

        "Question": "I really like using ClassNames and memberNames as convention but I am not sure how I would name the file containing a class. I like making my classes defined in a file with the exact same name as the class. But I also like making php files all lowercase. So I am conflicted. If I have a class called ProductGroup should that be defined in ProductGroup.php, productgroup.php, or product_group.php? I know there is no right answer, so I am looking for what is most common or your opinion of which to use.. which do you use? ",

        "Best answer": "At work we use underscores as folder delimiters and name the files exactly the same as the path. The autoloader is very simple, it just has to replace _ with / and add '.php' to the end. ProjectName_Models_ProductGroup() will always reside in ProjectName/Models/ProductGroup.php. It can make for some very long class names, but it doesn't really matter with an IDE. You could use the same convention, but just run strtolower() before including the file. ",
